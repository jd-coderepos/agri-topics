Adaptation to Climate Change in Agriculture,yes,n/a,,,"Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture || This topic explores the effects of future climate change on agricultural productivity, focusing on the variability in rainfall, extreme weather events, and irrigation needs. It includes studies using various climate models and scenarios to project changes in crop water requirements, yields, and food security across different regions, with an emphasis on maize, soybean, and wheat production. The research underscores the uncertainty in projections and the importance of developing adaptation strategies to sustain agriculture in the face of global climate change.","Impact of Climate Change on Crop Production and Potential Adaptive Measures in the Olifants Catchment, South Africa","Climate change is expected to substantially reduce future crop yields in South Africa, thus affecting food security and livelihood. Adaptation strategies need to be implemented to mitigate the effect of climate change-induced yield losses. In this paper, we used the WEAP-MABIA model, driven by six CORDEX climate change data for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, to quantify the effect of climate change on several key crops, namely maize, soya beans, dry beans, and sunflower, in the Olifants catchment. The study further investigated climate change adaptation such as the effects of changing planting dates with the application of full irrigation, rainwater harvesting, deficit irrigation method, and the application of efficient irrigation devices on reducing the impact of climate change on crop production. The results show that average monthly temperature is expected to increase by 1 °C to 5 °C while a reduction in precipitation ranging between 2.5% to 58.7% is projected for both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 relative to the baseline climate for 1976–2005, respectively. The results also reveal that increased temperature and decreased precipitation during planting seasons are expected to increase crop water requirements. A steady decline in crop yield ranging between 19–65%, 11–38%, 16–42%, and 5–30% for maize, soya beans, dry beans, and sunflower, respectively, is also projected under both RCPs climate change scenarios. The study concludes that adaptation measures such as the integration of changing planting dates with full irrigation application and the use of rainwater harvest will help improve current and future crop production under the impact of climate change."
Factors Affecting Maize Yield and Lodging Resistance,yes,OA,,,"Hybrid Maize Nitrogen Management || This topic revolves around various field experiments focused on optimizing nitrogen application and irrigation strategies for hybrid maize. Studies span diverse climates and explore effects of nitrogen timing (30, 45, 60 DAS), omission, and splitting, alongside irrigation scheduling, on maize yield and performance. Research sites include areas with challenging agro-climatic conditions, such as southern Ethiopia and humid sub-tropical regions, emphasizing the adaptability and management of maize cultivation to boost productivity under uneven and stressed conditions.","Maize (Zea mays L.) yield response to the effect of blended fertilizer and varieties under supplemental irrigation at Hadero Zuria Kebele, southern Ethiopia","Maize is one of the staple cereal crops in Ethiopia. However, in southern Ethiopia, the productivity of the crop is very low as compared to the average national productivity, which is mainly attributed to poor soil fertility and the use of low yielding varieties. Hence, a field experiment was conducted at Hadero Zuria kebele, southern Ethiopia under supplemental irrigation to investigate the effects of different rates of blended Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Sulphur, and Boron (NPSB) fertilizer on the performance of maize varieties. Treatments involving three varieties of maize (30G19, BH-546, and BH-547) and six rates of NPSB fertilizer (0, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150) kg ha?1 were tested in RCBD using a factorial arrangement with three replications. Data on crop Phenological, growth, yield, and yield components were collected. The results showed that the blended NPSB fertilizer rates and varieties of maize affected days to physiological maturity, leaf area, leaf area index, hundred kernels weight (HKW), dry biomass yield (DBY), and grain yield (GY). The highest mean values for HKW, DBY, and GY were obtained from the 150 kg ha?1 NPSB rate. Similarly, the highest values for DBY and GY were obtained from the BH-546 variety. Significant differences (P 0.05) were obtained on days to tasseling, days to silking, and harvest index (HI) due to the interaction effect of NPSB rates and varieties. As the NPSB rates increased from 0 to 150 kg ha?1, HKW and DBY increased consistently from 29.62 to 36.62 g and 31.41 to 43.70 t ha?,1 respectively. Grain yield showed a highly significant and positive correlation with cob length, leaf number, HI, HKW, and DBY. Also, maximized economic profitability was gained at a rate of 150 kg ha?1 NPSB fertilizer. Thus, from this result, the NPSB rate of 150 kg ha?1 with the hybrid maize variety BH-546 could be better for the study area."
Water Resource Management and Agricultural Technology,no,ctfidf,,precise,"""Ancient Water Engineering Systems || This topic explores the ancient methods and technologies utilized for water management, including the construction and maintenance of underground tunnels, aqueducts, and hydraulic structures without modern equipment. Focusing on systems like the Karez, qanats, and historical hydraulic engineering across various civilizations, the documents cover geological aspects, the significance of these water supply systems in arid zones, and their influence on today's hydrogeology and water resource management. Ancient practices of digging and tunneling to harness and distribute water, reflecting technological advancements and the adaptation to geographical and environmental conditions, are emphasized.""",Dynamics of the hydraulic and alluvial regime of the lower reaches of the Amudarya after the commissioning of the Takhiatash and Tuyamuyun hydrosystems,"The article presents data on changes in the main hydraulic parameters of the flow in the hydrological sections of the Amudarya river located in the zone of influence of the Takhiatash and Tuyamuyun reservoirs. It has been established that in recent years an acute water shortage has been observed in the lower reaches of the river during the growing season. In dry years for the Amudarya River, the Takhiatash hydroelectric complex becomes the last section, in some periods there are even no sanitary passes through the hydroelectric complex in the prescribed manner, and as a result, a tense situation is created in the Amudarya delta below the Takhiatash hydroelectric complex. Analysis of the hydrological regime of the river showed that in the lower reaches of the Amudarya on the territory of the Kharezm region and Karakalpakstan, the water regime of the river is very different from the domestic one. The low-water period on the river practically begins in September, as there is a large flow of water in September and October. The waters coming from the upper reaches of the river are retained to fill the Tuyamuyun reservoir. At the same time, the end of the low-water period is actually shifted to the beginning of March, since in March, the work of the water accumulated in the reservoir begins and its supply for flushing irrigation begins. The flood waters entering the Tuyamuyun reservoir are either fully accumulated (if the reservoirs are not filled up to the normal retention level of the NRL) or are very strongly transformed (if the reservoir is filled up to the NRL). Analysis of the dynamics of sediment runoff showed that the amplitudes of fluctuations in sediment runoff over periods have a very wide range of changes. In the initial period of operation of the hydroelectric complex, the sediment runoff mode almost repeats the household mode, that is, the largest runoff occurs during the dry season, but with the lowest solid runoff values on average 3 and 8 (at the Samanbai station) times. For 7 years from 1975 to 1981, the annual flow at the Kipchak gauging station amounted to 41.722 thousand tons, that is, 32% of the annual household regime. The largest annual flow at the Kipchak and Samanbai gauging stations took place in the high-water year 1978 and amounted to 66329 and 57971 thousand tons ??????????????. The smallest amount of annual runoff at gauging stations was observed in dry 1981 and amounted to 25074 and 3943 thousand tons. The study of the sediment runoff regime of the Amudarya river during the period of joint operation of the Takhiatash and Tyuyamuyun hydrosystems showed that the amount of solid runoff entering the zone of influence of the Takhiatash hydroelectric complex significantly decreased due to a sharp decrease in water discharge under the influence of regulation and low water. At the same time, as the analysis of field studies has shown, despite their relatively small number, accumulation of sediments is observed in the pays of the hydroelectric complex, that is, silting occurs. The amount of sediment siltation in the area of the Takhiatash hydroelectric complex varies depending on the water content of the year and the operating mode of the Takhiatash hydroelectric complex. Analysis of the alluvial regime shows that during the period of operation of the hydroelectric complex, depending on the hydrological regime of the river and the regime of the water level in front of the dam, the clarification of the flow occurs in April, May, June and August. The seasonally average clarification of the flow within the upper pool ranges from 10 to 40%, and in some months, at levels close to the NSP, reaches 90%, that is, the upper pool of the node turns into a kind of settling tank. The composition of suspended sediments of the Amudarya varies both in time and along the length of the river, but particles smaller than 0.25 mm remain predominant. Particles larger than 0.25 mm are found only in the upper areas and in an amount of no more than 3 - 4%. During the flood period, along the entire length of the river, the percentage of fines content increases in comparison with the low-water period."

Research focuses on identifying serotypes, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and the development of PCR assays for detection. This alarming situation indicates a significant public health risk, primarily through the contamination of vegetables and potential spread in the hospital environment, urging the need for improved water hygiene and monitoring practices.","Campylobacteriosis Outbreak Associated with Contaminated Municipal Water Supply — Nebraska, 2017","In March 2017, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) and the Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department were notified of an apparent cluster of Campylobacter jejuni infections in city A and initiated an investigation. Overall, 39 cases were investigated, including six confirmed and 33 probable. Untreated, unboiled city A tap water (i.e., well water) was the only exposure significantly associated with illness (odds ratio [OR] = 7.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-36.36). City A is served by four untreated wells and an interconnected distribution system. Onsite investigations identified that a center pivot irrigation system intended to pump livestock wastewater from a nearby concentrated animal feeding operation onto adjacent farmland had malfunctioned, allowing excessive runoff to collect in a road ditch near two wells that supplied water to the city. These wells were promptly removed from service, after which no subsequent cases occurred. This coordinated response rapidly identified an important risk to city A's municipal water supply and provided the evidence needed to decommission the affected wells, with plans to build a new well to safely serve this community."

The documents also discuss the impact of irrigation on food security, environmental sustainability, and economic viability across different global contexts.",Necessity of Irrigated and Rainfed Agriculture in the World,"The results show that 54% of the world is suitable for rainfed agriculture whereas 80% of agricultural production is form rainfed areas. Therefore, increasing irrigated agriculture is necessary. But, why tendency to irrigation is low? In many areas of the world, water resources are limited and irrigation is not economical. In pressurized irrigation, although irrigation efficiency is high but amount of required water is lower than surface irrigation but cost of pressurized method is very high. Agricultural integration is an affordable approach. Moreover, increasing irrigation efficiency led to use of surface irrigation in small farms. However, selection of an appropriate method for irrigation is more important than other mentioned cases. In some conditions, deficit irrigation is sufficient to achieve to maximum of production. In other conditions, notifying to all effective factors (to choose irrigation system) include compatibility, economics, topographical characteristics, soils, water supply, crops, social influences, external influences and awareness of advantages and disadvantages of different irrigation systems (Table 1) led to maximizing efficiency and finally increasing tendency to irrigated agriculture."

Plots were 10 ft X 25 ft, arranged in a RCB design with four replications. Plots were sampled on 19 Apr (PRE), 29 Apr (10 DAT), 6 May (17 DAT), and 24 May (35 DAT). On the first three sampling dates, a 4-inch2 section of wheat was cut at ground level and removed from the field in a paper bag. Each sample was weighed before being placed in a Berlese funnel for 24 h to extract mites. Mites were counted under a dissecting microscope, and the number divided by the sample weight to get a BGM/g value which was used for statistical analysis. On the final sampling date (35 DAT), 25 random tillers were picked from each plot, and placed in Berlese funnels for 24 h to extract mites. The number of BGM/tiller was used for statistical analysis. The plots were harvested on 23 Jul using a modified Gleaner L combine with on board scales. Test weight was measured from a sub sample of the grain harvested from each plot."

It discusses specific issues in regions like the Arabian Gulf, sub-Saharan Africa, and Syria, as well as the effects and criticisms of the Green Revolution and rural development initiatives in countries like India. The collection emphasizes the need for sustainable agricultural practices and policies to ensure food security amid escalating demands and diminishing resources.",The Office du Niger: an Agropole project for food security in Mali?,"In many African countries, food security is now more valued by agricultural policies than ever before. Since WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union) regards the irrigated area of the Niger Office in Mali as the “rice bowl” of West Africa, this agricultural area has thus become at the heart of regional economy and politics. In this context, agricultural development programs are multiplying, leading to the “new green revolution” supported by international organizations, donors and a number of foundations. These development projects are usually managed by foreign private investors and benefit from large-scale land allocation. This model of agricultural and commercial development has been criticized as a form of land and water grabbing. It raises questions with regards to its role in securing the population’s food supply and the future of small family farms. The role of small farming in food security was recently reaffirmed during the “International Year of Family Farming” (2014)."
Intercropping in Agricultural Systems,no,both,complementary,complementary,"Weed Management in Agriculture || This topic explores various studies and field experiments focused on the effectiveness of weed control practices in agriculture. It covers the use of pendimethalin and other pre-emergence herbicides, the impact of hand weeding, and the outcomes of different weed-free and weed management strategies on crop yield. The documents highlight research conducted in diverse geographical locations and conditions, underlining the challenges and methods for controlling weed interference in crops ranging from tuberoses to mustard, within irrigated systems.",Alternatives for sustainable weed control in single? and double?cropped soybean: A case study for Mediterranean irrigated conditions,"The irrigated cropping systems in South Europe could benefit from soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.] introduction in their maize ( Zea mays L.)?based crop rotations. However, sustainable weed management strategies are needed for soybean growers under Mediterranean irrigated conditions. This work aimed to assess the weed control efficacy, and the soybean performance, of alternative management practices for single? and double?cropped soybean. Two field experiments were carried out in northeast Spain in the period 2019–2021. Row width narrowing (75–37.5 cm), herbicide application (yes/no), and roller?crimped rye [ Secale cereal (L.) M.Bieb.] cover crop (yes/no) were assessed in the single cropping system experiment (SCS). In the barley?soybean double cropping system experiment (DCS), row width narrowing and herbicide application were assessed. In the SCS, the presence of rye cover crop reduced weed biomass up to 92% compared to the controls without herbicide and cover crop in 2020. In 2021, no effect of the cover crop on weed pressure was found due to the low amount of rye biomass accumulated (11.8 and 3.4 ton DM ha ?1 in 2020 and 2021, respectively). In the DCS, herbicide application attained the expected weed control. Row width narrowing to 37.5 cm did not have an impact on weed pressure nor on soybean yield in either experiment. We concluded that herbicide reduction for single?cropped soybean under Mediterranean irrigated conditions can be achieved by roller?crimping a rye cover crop, provided enough rye biomass is accumulated. In the DCS, our results indicated that further research is needed to find alternatives to chemical weed control."

It includes analyses of milk yield differences from cows grazed on diverse pastures or fed drylot diets, the nutritional content of different forage diets, and their impact on the dairy production process, emphasizing on dry matter production, grass-legume mixes, and forage quality in dairy farming.",Contribution of Awns to Seed Yield and Seed Shattering in Siberian Wildrye Grown under Irrigated and Rainfed Environments,"The seed yield of grass species is greatly dependent on inflorescence morphological traits, starting with spikelets per inflorescence and seeds per spikelet, to kernel size, and then to awns. Previous studies have attempted to estimate the contribution of these traits on the harvested yield of major cereal crops, but little information can be accessed on the influence of awns on seed yield of forage grass species. Siberian wildrye (Elymus sibiricus L.) is a widely important perennial forage grass used to increase forage production in arid and semi-arid grasslands. The grass has long inflorescences with long awns developed at the tip end of the lemmas in the florets. In order to evaluate the effect of awns on Siberian wildrye seed production, awn excision analyses from 10 accessions were performed at flowering stage under irrigated and rainfed regimes. Overall, awn excision reduced thousand-seed weight and seed size under both irrigated and rainfed regimes, which decreased final seed yield per plant. De-awned plants produced significantly more seeds per inflorescence, but spikelets per inflorescence was not influenced by awn excision in either condition. Moreover, histological analyses showed a high degradation of the abscission layer in the awned plants than de-awned ones, and awn excision evidently improved average seed breaking tensile strength (BTS), and thus decreased the degree of seed shattering. In conclusion, the observed significant impact of awn excision on different yield-related traits mirrored the impact of awns on the performance of Siberian wildrye under diverse growing conditions. These results provide useful information for plant breeders, seed producers, and researchers to efficiently improve seed production in Siberian wildrye."

Around the beginning of 1980 life had become a little dull and we thought a change was necessary. So, after some haggling a 620 ha property was bought. It tended to be a little bedraggled as we could only keep three mobs of sheep apart but after putting on sixty-five gates, digging in thirty-one strainers and mending fifty-four broken wires, we ended up with forty-three paddocks ranging in size from one to twenty-five hectares. The property lies on the coast some 8 kms north of where the Waitaki river flows into the Pacific Ocean. The soil is of the poorer Steward type, with a pH of 5.5 and phosphate reading of 5-8, and is situated at the lower end of the Morven-Glenavy irrigation scheme.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of application rates of biofertilizer and irrigation on yield, growth, and leaf chlorophyll and nutrient content of Mexican Sunflower. In an experiment in the Brazilian semi-arid region, we used a 5 2 factorial arrangement, consisting of five application rates of biofertilizer (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 m3 ha-1), with and without irrigation. The statistical design was randomized blocks with three replications. Irrigated plants of Mexican Sunflower had greater dry and fresh matter yields, greater height, and greater leaf area index and leaf contents of K, Zn, and B. However, the high concentration of bicarbonate in the irrigation water reduced the leaf contents of N, Ca, S, Fe, and Mn. The mean increase in the two cuttings obtained with the use of irrigation was 350% and 314% for fresh and dry matter, respectively. The increase in the biofertilizer application increased the leaf chlorophyll contents of irrigated plants; however, it did not result in production or nutritional gains. In regions with low availability of rainfall, irrigated cultivation of Mexican Sunflower is recommended."

Various irrigation methods, including alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and continuous flooding, are investigated for their impact on GHG reduction, water efficiency, and rice yield, aiming at mitigating global warming potential while ensuring sustainable rice production.",Effects of Water Management Practices on Methane Emissions and Rice Yields in East Asian Paddy Fields: A Regional-Scale Meta-Analysis,"Paddy fields are considered one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions. Drainage of the flooded soils can reduce CH4 substantially, but rice yields can be variable depending on soil drainage. Therefore, to reduce this variability, water management effects on CH4 emissions and rice yields were comprehensively analyzed in paddy fields of countries similar to Korea. Here, we selected 161 observations of water management and 174 observations of rice yields from 28 articles and conducted a regional-scale meta-analysis of the effects of water management practices on CH4 emissions and rice yields in paddy fields. As a result of the analysis, we found that water management practices in East Asian paddy fields reduced methane by 60.5%. Water management practices in paddy fields decreased rice yield by 5.8% but there was no significant. The water management practices of the paddy fields with a high CH4 emission reduction effect and no impact on rice yields were alternating wet and dry (AWD), flooding-drainage-reflooding (FDF), and moist irrigation (MI) practices. Therefore, it is considered that the above three practices can be applied in Korea. The results of this study are expected to predict CH4 emissions and rice yields generated by water management practices in East Asian rice paddies in the future and be used as basic data for the development of national unique coefficients.A response ratio of CH4 emissions (A) and rice yields (B) by water management types."

In the current study, corn cob-derived biochar (CB) was used to reduce the negative effects of saline water on quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa cv. Utosaya Q37) grown on Aridisols and Entisols, which are the major soil groups of Egyptian soils. Quinoa plants were cultivated in pot experiment and were irrigated with saline water (EC = 10 dS m?1). The experiment contained three treatments, including control without any treatment, biochar at a rate of 1% (w/w) (BC1), and biochar at a rate of 3% (w/w) (BC3). The findings of the current study showed that BC treatments realized significant effects on soil salinity, pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and plant availability and nutrients’ uptake in the two soils types. BC3 increased the SOM in Entisols and Aridisols by 23 and 44%; moreover, the dry biomass of quinoa plants was ameliorated by 81 and 41%, respectively, compared with the control. Addition of biochar to soil increased the nutrients’ use efficiencies by quinoa plants for the two studied Egyptian soils. Biochar addition caused significant increases in the use efficiency of nitrogen (NUF), phosphorus (PUE), and potassium (KUE) by quinoa plants. BC3 increased NUE, PUE, and KUS by 81, 81, and 80% for Entisols, while these increases were 40, 41, and 42% in the case of Aridisols. Based on the obtained results, the application of corn cob biochar improves the soil quality and alleviates the negative effects of saline irrigation on quinoa plants grown on Aridisols and Entisols Egyptian soils. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment in arid and semi-arid regions to reduce the salinity hazards."

Multiparous (5.1 ± 1.4 yr old), crossbred (Red Angus × Red Poll × Tarentaise × South Devon × Devon), lactating beef cows (n = 65) with summer born calves (mean calving date = July 14) were used in a randomized complete block design. Pairs in eastern (ARDC; n = 36) or western (PHREC; n = 29) Nebraska were blocked by cow BW (4 blocks at ARDC, 2 blocks at PHREC), stratified by calf age, and assigned randomly within strata to 1 of 2 wintering treatments with either 4 (ARDC) or 2 (PHREC) replications (pens or paddocks) per treatment (4– 8 pairs per replicate). Treatments included: 1) drylot feeding (DL) or 2) corn residue grazing (CS). Drylot pairs were limit-fed (12.5 ± 0.23 kg (ARDC) or 12.4 ± 0.1 kg DM/pair/d (PHREC)) a common diet (60:40 distillers grains:crop residue, DM basis). Regardless of location, CS pairs grazed irrigated corn residue and were supplemented (2.4 kg DM/pair/d) with a dried distillers grains pellet. After cornstalk grazing, all calves were weaned (calf age = 267– 285 d). Cornstalks pairs at ARDC grazed from early-November to mid-April (158 d), while pairs at PHREC grazed for 62 d during 2 separate periods due to snowfall. At both locations, DL cows had greater (P ? 0.03) BW change. Ending BCS was not different (P = 0.63) between CS (5.2) and DL (5.4) cows at PHREC. At ARDC, DL cows had greater (P 0.01) ending BCS (6.0) compared to cows that grazed cornstalks (4.6). Cow BCS change was not different (P = 0.34) between treatments at PHREC, but greater (P 0.01) for DL cows at ARDC. Wintering system had no effect (P = 0.57) on calf ending BW at PHREC, but calves wintered in the drylot with their dams at ARDC were heavier (P = 0.02) than CS calves (305 vs. 253 kg, respectively). Likewise, calf ADG and BW per d of age were not affected (P ? 0.50) at PHREC, but were greater for DL (P ? 0.04) calves at ARDC. Diverging responses observed across locations are likely due to grazing d and residue diet quality. Grazing residue may be a viable option for summer-born pairs, but performance may be similar to or less than DL pairs."

We evaluated the index of short glandular trichomes (SGT) in the cacao phylloplane and the effect of irrigation on the disease index of cacao genotypes with or without resistance to WBD, and identified proteins present in the phylloplane. The resistant genotype CCN51 and susceptible Catongo presented a mean index of 1,600 and 700 SGT cm-2, respectively. The disease index in plants under drip irrigation was reduced by approximately 30% compared with plants under sprinkler irrigation prior to inoculation. Leaf water wash (LWW) of the cacao inhibited the germination of spores by up to 98%. Proteins from the LWW of CCN51 were analyzed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The gel showed 71 spots and identified a total of 42 proteins (28 from the plant and 14 from bacteria). Proteins related to defense and synthesis of defense metabolites and involved in nucleic acid metabolism were identified. The results support the hypothesis that the proteins and water-soluble compounds secreted to the cacao phylloplane participate in the defense against pathogens. They also suggest that SGT can contribute to the resistance of cacao."

The research shows that increased nutrition appropriately raises the yield of Bellarosa potato variety. The introduction of calculated fertilizer doses aimed at obtaining 30 tons of potato per hectare has increased the yield by 8.17–10.96 t/hectare depending on the planting density. Over 4 years of research the highest yield of 31.18 t/hectare was obtained when the planting density was 66.6 thousand tubers per hectare. It’s worth noting that higher planting density increased the effectiveness of the fertilizer introduced in calculated doses for this level of yield. The increase in potato harvest, in this case, was 4.22 and 5.81 t/hectare. The following increase in planting density with further enhancement of nutrition didn’t show such high effectiveness. For example, in the case of fertilizer dose calculated for the yield of 35 t/hectare the increase of density to 60.6 and 66.6 thousand tubers per hectare (in comparison with 55.5 thousand) gave the rise of 1.62 and 2.62 t/hectare in yield.

These forage sources vary greatly in nutritional content and availability due to season, plant species and climatic factors. Therefore, ruminants are exposed to nutrient excesses and deficiencies at varying points during the reproductive cycle. The objectives of this presentation are 1) to review our understanding of the impact of nutritional changes experienced by the dam during gestation on subsequent reproductive performance of female offspring, 2) examine the timing and duration of nutrient restriction on indicators of fertility in domestic ruminants and 3) compare responses under production conditions to mechanisms determined in controlled experiments. Depending on the time and severity of the nutrient deprivation, physiological effects include reduced gonadal weight, reduction in 2° and 3° follicles, alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, fetal weight and attainment of puberty. Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) are indicators of fertility in ruminants. Severe nutrient deprivation of heifers during the first trimester of gestation reduced AMH and AFC in female offspring. In contrast, a more moderate nutritional challenge to mature cows during early gestation did not result in changes in AMH and AFC in female offspring. Heifers from dams that grazed protein deficient range during the third trimester had delayed puberty onset and reduced pregnancy rates compared to heifers from supplemented dams. Recently, we compared indictors of fertility in heifers from dams that grazed range or irrigated pastures during the first two trimesters. Based on preliminary data, cows that grazed range were nutritionally challenged; however, heifers from range dams did not appear to differ in indicators of fertility from heifers from dams grazing irrigated pastures. Continued investigations on impacts of maternal nutrition on reproduction in offspring under production conditions are warranted."

An extensive scientific health risk assessment and epidemiological study to determine the actual health risks, is very expensive and requires medical and financial justification. The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical health risk model, which could be used as a predictive tool to determine as accurately as possible from the data available if a complete scientific health risk assessment study is justified. The actual amounts of pesticides sold in the Vaalharts area by two major pesticide manufacturers were used to perform a theoretical health risk assessment. The risks were assessed by making use of RISK*ASSISTANT, a computer modeling system and chemical database. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) health risk model was applied to the data to identify the hazards, assess the exposures and dose response, and characterize the risks. Three exposure scenarios, namely, the ingestion of food and water and the inhalation of air were evaluated. The method used to calculate the risks varied according to the type of health hazard and the results were characterized accordingly. The acute health effects due to exposure to pesticides are well known and the risks are easy to determine. However, the risks associated with chronic health hazards were more difficult to calculate. For this reason a ranking model was developed which made use of a point scoring system. This model highlights those pesticides which have the greatest possibility of causing chronic health effects. From the results it can be concluded that very large amounts of pesticides are used in the Vaalharts area and that the community might be at risk to chronic health effects. Although the theoretical health risk assessment model was successfully used in this study, its effectiveness as a predictive tool still has to be proven by a complete scientific study."
Rice Water Management and Productivity Enhancement,,,,,"""Nitrogen Management in Irrigation || This topic explores the effects of various irrigation methods on nitrogen utilization in agriculture, focusing on nitrate leaching, nitrogen balance, and the recovery efficiency of applied nitrogen. It includes studies using 15N-labeled urea to trace nitrogen's fate and losses in different crops and soil types under conditions such as water-saving irrigation, fertilizer deep placement, and varying nitrogen application rates. The goal is to identify practices that enhance nitrogen use efficiency and minimize environmental impacts in different agricultural systems.""",Nitrogen balance in paddy fields under flowing-irrigation condition,"Flowing irrigation which drains a large volume of water is one of agricultural techniques for ensuring rice quality. In this study, the nitrogen input and output were characterised in paddy fields under flowing irrigation based on observation in Central Japan, and the estimated nitrogen loadings were compared to the reported values in traditional paddy fields under stagnant irrigation by using budget analysis. The annual water fluxes in the studied fields were calculated to be more than ten times larger than those in traditional fields. The concentrations of most nitrogen forms in surface drainage and subsurface drainage were detected at highest level during paddling periods, while those of nitrate and nitrite in subsurface drainage increased during non-irrigation periods. The total nitrogen inputs were at upper level (236–332 kg N ha ?1 ) of or larger (490–581 kg N ha ?1 ) than the reported values under both flowing irrigation and stagnant irrigation, and the larger contribution of irrigation pathway was observed. Surface drainage (78.3–163.5 kg N ha ?1 ) and transport to underground system (73.1–210.4 kg N ha ?1 ) were significantly higher than reported values obtained from stagnant-irrigation paddy fields. The differences between input and output were thereby estimated and the large negative balance was attributed to the soil accumulation, which was distinctly detected in the field with presumably higher adsorption capacity. Therefore, assessing the effect of water flow on soil nitrogen accumulation as well as discharge is recommended by evaluating nitrogen balance in paddy field."

The present investigation was conducted to study the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus to drought tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under normal irrigated conditions and in water stress created by withholding irrigation at jointing and heading stage under net house environment. Wheat seeds of two wheat varieties WH 1025 and WH 1105 were grown in pots after treatment with or without the AMF. Under water stress conditions, the wheat variety WH 1025 performed better in terms of growth and yield attributes as compared to WH 1105. The results obtained showed a significant improvement by AMF on plant height, number of productive tillers, spike length, number of spikelet, grain/spike, grain weight/spike and test weight under both irrigated and drought stress condition. Biomass and grain yields were higher in plants treated with mycorrhiza than non-mycorrhizal plants of both the varieties irrespective of soil moisture. Therefore, the results suggest that mycorrhizal inoculation play a vital role in improving growth and yield in wheat by reducing the effects of drought stress and sustain the wheat crop under the semi-arid environments."

Studies explore how different water management strategies affect soil-plant water relations, fruit size, water content, soluble solids, and storage life in apple orchards, aiming to enhance water use efficiency and fruit quality in both continental and other climates.",Irrigation Regimes Affect Fruit Soluble Solids Concentration and Rate of Water Loss of `O'Henry' Peaches,"The effect of irrigation management strategies on the quality and storage performance of `O'Henry' peaches [ Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] was studied for two seasons. The deficit irrigation treatment induced a higher fruit soluble solids concentration and lower fruit weight. The excess irrigation treatment, compared to the optimum treatment, increased the rate of fruit water loss without altering fruit quality and storage performance. Scanning electron microscope observations indicated a higher density of trichomes on fruit from the deficit and optimum irrigation treatments than from the excess irrigation treatment. Light microscopy studies indicated that fruit from deficit and optimum irrigation had a continuous and much thicker cuticle than fruit from the excess irrigation treatment. These differences in exodermis structure may explain the high percentage of water loss from fruit from the excess irrigation treatment compared to the deficit and optimum irrigation treatments."

Research spans multiple locations and crop types, including maize, wheat, and potatoes, examining parameters like canopy cover, biomass, grain yield, and water use efficiency. Models were adjusted using field data across different climates and irrigation conditions to enhance the model's accuracy in predicting crop responses to water.""",Usefulness of cultivar-level calibration of AquaCrop for vegetables depends on the crop and data availability,"As a result of climate change, climatic extremes are expected to increase. For high-value crops like vegetables, irrigation is a potentially economically viable adaptation measure in western Europe. To optimally schedule irrigation, decision support systems based on crop models like AquaCrop are increasingly used by farmers. High value vegetable crops like cauliflower or spinach are grown in two distinct growth cycles per year and, additionally, have a high turnover rate of new varieties. To successfully deploy the AquaCrop model in a decision support system, it requires a robust calibration. However, it is not known whether parameters can be conserved over both growth periods, nor whether a cultivar dependent model calibration is always required. Furthermore, when data are collected from farmers' fields, there are constraints in data availability and uncertainty. We collected data from commercial cauliflower and spinach fields in Belgium in 2019, 2020 and 2021 during different growing periods and of different cultivars. With the use of a Bayesian calibration, we confirmed the need for a condition or cultivar specific calibration for cauliflower, while for spinach, splitting the data per cultivar or pooling the data together did not improve uncertainty on the model simulations. However, due to uncertainties arising from field specific soil and weather conditions, or measurement errors from calibration data, real time field specific adjustments are advised to simulations when using AquaCrop as decision support tool. Remotely sensed or in situ ground data may be invaluable information to reduce uncertainty on model simulations."

The aim is to enhance yield, quality, and efficiency in onion farming under various environmental conditions, thereby addressing issues like low productivity and high post-harvest losses prevalent in many regions.","The Influence of Phosphorus and Transplanting Date on Onion (<i>Allium Cepa</i> L.) Quality Parameters and yield of bulb Under Irrigation at Adami Tulu Jedo Kombolcha Woreda, East showa zone, Oromia Region","A field experiment was showed to decide the influence of phosphorus level and transplanting date on quality parameters of onion at Adami Tulu Jedo Kombolcha Woreda, during 2017/18 season. The treatments consisted of four phosphorus levels (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg P ha ?1 ) and three transplanting date (42, 49 and 56 days). The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with four replications. The result showed that phosphorus level and transplanting date significantly influenced bulb dry matter content, marketable bulb yield, medium size bulb yield. Among these parameters, marketable bulb yield was also significantly influenced by the interaction of phosphorus level and transplanting date. On the other hand, small size bulb yield, large size bulb yield, over size bulb yield and under size bulb yield were only influenced by the effect of phosphorus levels. In this study, fertilized 60 kg P ha ?1 with transplanting at 56 days of transplanting date recorded the highest marketable bulb yield, but no significant difference was showed with that obtained at 40 kg P ha ?1 with the same transplanting date. Treatment combinations of no P (control) and transplanting date at 42 days produced the lowest amounts of marketable bulb yield. The economic analysis revealed that the highest net benefit with low cost of production was obtained in response to the application of 40 kg P ha ?1 and the transplanting age of 56 days. The marginal rate of return for this treatment was 11983% which is found to be economically feasible for producing bulb in the districts."

Studies have been attempted using irrigation to simulate flooding (1, 3). Results have been inconsistent and flood damage was often difficult to induce. However, during 5 days in 1984, Hurricane Diana resulted in 267.5 mm of rainfall on sweet potato cultivar plots at the Horticultural Crops Research Station in Clinton, N.C. The plots were planted in a Norfolk sandy loam soil. When plots were harvested 2 weeks later, flood damage was readily apparent. Typical symptoms of flooding injury included visible soft, rotted areas, growth of saprophytic fungi on the surface and a noticeable odor of fermentation. Roots were separated into three groups (total marketable, culls, and flood-damaged roots) and weighed. Samples were also taken of apparently sound roots for intercellular space and dry matter evaluations (four roots each) and for determining amount of sub-sequent rotting during curing and storing (12–13 kg). Intercellular space and percent dry matter were determined according to Kushman and Pope (2)."

In-depth investigation into microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely used to achieve a comprehensive understanding of plant defense mechanisms. However, there is limited knowledge on the association of miRNAs with drought tolerance in cigar tobacco. In this study, a hydroponic experiment was carried out to identify changes in plant physiological characteristics, miRNA expression and metabolite profile under drought stress, and examine the mitigating effects of selenium (Se) application. The shoot dry weight of drought-stressed plants was approximately half (50.3%) of that in non-stressed (control) conditions. However, plants supplied with Se attained 38.8% greater shoot dry weight as compared to plants with no Se supply under drought stress. Thirteen miRNAs were identified to be associated with drought tolerance. These included 7 known (such as nta-miR156b and nta-miR166a) and 6 novel miRNAs (such as novel-nta-miR156-5p and novel-nta-miR209-5p) with the target genes of squamosa promoter-binding-like protein 4 (SPL4), serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2A), cation/calcium exchanger 4-like (CCX4), extensin-1-like (EXT1) and reduced wall acetylation 2 (RWA2). Further investigation revealed that the expression levels of Ext1 and RWA2 were significantly decreased under drought stress but increased with Se addition. Moreover, key metabolites such as catechin and N-acetylneuraminic acid were identified, which may play a role in the regulation of drought tolerance. The integrated analysis of miRNA sequencing and metabolome highlighted the significance of the novel-nta-miR97-5p- LRR-RLK- catechin pathway in regulating drought tolerance. Our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drought tolerance and Se-induced stress alleviation in cigar tobacco."

However, the genetic architecture of stem WSCs' accumulation is partially understood, and few candidate genes are known. This study utilizes the compressed mixed linear model-based genome wide association study (GWAS) and heuristic post GWAS analyses to identify causative quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and candidate genes for stem WSCs' content at 15 days after anthesis under different water regimes (irrigated, rainfed, and drought). Glucose, fructose, sucrose, fructans, total non-structural carbohydrates (the sum of individual sugars), total WSCs (anthrone based) quantified in the peduncle of 301 bread wheat genotypes under multiple environments (E01-E08) pertaining different water regimes, and 14,571 SNPs from ""35K Axiom Wheat Breeders"" Array were used for analysis. As a result, 570 significant nucleotide trait associations were identified on all chromosomes except for 4D, of which 163 were considered stable. A total of 112 quantitative trait nucleotide regions (QNRs) were identified of which 47 were presumable novel. QNRs qWSC-3B.2 and qWSC-7A.2 were identified as the hotspots. Post GWAS integration of multiple data resources prioritized 208 putative candidate genes delimited into 64 QNRs, which can be critical in understanding the genetic architecture of stem WSCs accumulation in wheat under optimum and water-stressed environments. At least 19 stable QTNs were found associated with 24 prioritized candidate genes. Clusters of fructans metabolic genes reported in the QNRs qWSC-4A.2 and qWSC-7A.2. These genes can be utilized to bring an optimum combination of various fructans metabolic genes to improve the accumulation and remobilization of stem WSCs and water stress tolerance. These results will further strengthen wheat breeding programs targeting sustainable wheat production under limited water conditions."

Four irrigation regimes (every 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks) and four inoculation treatments (beet necrotic yellow vein virus [BNYVV], beet soilborne mosaic virus [BSBMV], BNYVV+BSBMV, and a noninoculated control) were arranged in a split-plot design and replicated four times. Irrigation frequency and virus infection affected disease severity and yield. Sugar beets irrigated every 4 weeks had the lowest disease severity, and yield was not significantly different from the every 2 weeks frequency. Sucrose content was higher for beets in the 4-week irrigation treatment compared with the 2- and 3-week frequencies. Beets inoculated with BNYVV had higher disease severity and lower root yield than beets inoculated with BSBMV and BNYVV+BSBMV. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of water level on disease severity and water use in sugar beet. Four treatments (BNYVV, BSBMV, BNYVV+BSBMV, and a noninoculated control) and three water levels (pot capacity [PC], 75% PC, and 50% PC) were arranged in a split-plot design and replicated five times. Pots of each treatment were weighed every other day to determine evapotranspiration. Evaporation was determined from unplanted pots, and plant transpiration was calculated by the difference. Beets irrigated at 75% pot capacity showed minimal disease incidence and a root weight comparable to the fully irrigated healthy control. Plants in the BNYVV treatment had a significantly higher disease severity than beets infected by BSBMV or BNYVV+BSBMV. Root weights and plant water use were significantly affected by virus infection. Beets in the BNYVV+BSBMV treatment had a significantly higher root dry weight and water use than beets in the BNYVV treatment, suggesting that BSBMV reduced the impact of disease caused by BNYVV."

The study showed that the average amount of trash content present in seed cotton was typically 10%. The seed cotton cleaning process was able to remove 20 to 40% with the remainder of the trash removed by subsequent lint cleaning stages. The study also showed that the gin stand has no influence on fiber quality provided that the gin stand was not overloaded, maintained to manufacturers recommendations, and moisture levels maintained within the recommended levels. Flow-through air lint cleaners had no significant effect on fiber quality with minimal reduction in trash. The controlled-batt saw lint cleaners had positive and significant effects on color and trash; negative effects on length, length uniformity, short fiber and nep content, elongation; and no effect on strength, micronaire, fineness, maturity, number and size of SCN and fiber nep size. The batt-less saw lint cleaners had similar effects on fiber quality, although not as severe. The controlled-batt saw lint cleaners were more aggressive than the batt-less saw lint cleaners and removed more trash and hence achieved a better color grade, with this improvement resulting in notable reductions in lint turn out, fiber length, and increased short fiber and nep content."

The highest total (127.4 t ha-1) and commercial (108.6 t ha-1) yields were obtained with 413.9 and 384 kg ha-1 P2O5, respectively. The results showed that pH of tomato juice, the percentages of green, red, and commercial fruits were not influenced by the applied P rates. However, nutrient delivery increased the soluble solids content up to 356 kg ha-1 P2O5, which is interesting for tomato processing. After harvesting the fruits, the available soil P content was increased with P supply to the plants. For improvement of commercial yield and soluble solids characteristics, the tomato crop shall be fertilised with P even though the soil has high P content."

The model was run for 20 years from 1991 to 2010 for Palampur weather station. The results revealed 3.6 to 4.0 percent and 1.7 to 7.5 percent increase in simulated crop yield with 420 and 470 ppm CO2 respectively. The elevated maximum and minimum temperature by 1 and 20C with 370 ppm carbon dioxide reduced the anthesis period by 5-7 and 9-11 days respectively over the sowing window of November 15th to December 30th. Similarly, days to maturity also reduced by 4-5 and 7-8 days with 1 and 20C rise in temperature respectively. The simulated crop yield showed increase by 17.9 to 63.0 and 33.2 to 133.4 percent with 1 and 20C rise in temperature at 370 ppm CO2 under limited irrigations. The simulated grain yield at 420 ppm CO2 showed an increase of 23 to 69.7 percent with 10C and 39.5 to 123.5 percent with 20C whereas at 470 ppm CO2 level the increase was 27.9 to 76.1 at 10C and 46.4 to 133.0 percent with 20C rise in maximum and minimum temperatures respectively. Hence, simulated results of elevated temperature and CO2 levels proved to be beneficial in rabi wheat with adaptations strategy of limited irrigations under sub temperate climate of North Western Himalayas"
Genetic Diversity and Improvement of Soybean,,,,,"Soybean Water Stress Management || This topic centers around various studies and experiments addressing the management of water stress in soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.), focusing on cultivation practices aimed at improving yield and stress tolerance. Research spans early planting systems, irrigation timing, the impact of drought, and the role of exogenous treatments in drought-prone areas. It explores innovative strategies like deficit irrigation, use of osmoprotectants, and adjustments in fertilizer use to enhance soybean resilience against climatic challenges, thereby aiming to secure food production of this vital crop under varying water conditions.",Effects of Irrigation and Planting Geometry on Soybean (Glycine max L.) Seed Nutrition in Humid Climates,"This study investigates the effect of irrigation (FI, all rows-irrigation; HI, alternate row irrigation; RF, rainfed) and planting geometry (PG) (SR, single-row; TR, twin-row) on soybean seed constituents. Results showed that most of these seed components were significantly affected by crop season due to contrasting precipitation and solar radiation patterns, particularly during July-August, coinciding with early reproductive and seed development stages. Both seed protein and oil levels responded positively to irrigation, while most of the amino acids were nonresponsive. The protein content ranged between 36.3 and 37.6% in 2018, while it was between 36.4 and 38.3% in 2019. Among amino acids, glycine, alanine, valine, and methionine levels were significantly higher in both FI and HI treatments. Among sugars, only sucrose was higher in response to the RF treatment, and irrigation did not affect both stachyose and raffinose. Oleic acid was higher in RF, while no significant differences were observed for linolenic and linoleic acids. Similarly, seasonal variation was significant for stearic acid content, but the 2019 season had relatively higher accumulation (stearic acid: between 4.1 and 4.5% in 2018 and from 4.6 to 4.9% in 2019). These results indicate that both irrigation and climate during seed development can alter some seed composition constituents and play critical roles in determining seed nutritional qualities."

Studies conducted between 2010 and 2020 across various regions, including Iran and Pakistan, investigate irrigation schedules, foliar spray effects, and the genetic response of these oilseed crops under different water conditions, aiming to enhance production efficiency amidst increasing edible oil demands and water scarcity.",Quantitative and Qualitative Traits of Sunflower Genotypes as Influenced by Nitrogen Application through Fertigation,"P akistan is facing acute shortage of edible oil.The demand for edible oil in Pakistan is increasing with the uncontrollable increase in population.Its indigenous production is below the consumption levels with a very wide gap between production and consumption.This gap is bridged through import of edible oil worth more than Rs.45.0 billion annually.Pakistan ranks 3 rd largest edible oil importing country in the world (GoP, 2020).The country's oil requirement was about 2.966 million tons in which 0.83 million tons (28%) were locally produced and the rest edible oil was imported.The edible oil requirements have increased from 0.3 million tons to 1.95 million tons.But the domestic production of edible oil has remained inadequate and fluctuating for the last couple of decades.These fluctuations are due to indigenous marketing, low support price and high cost of production which is making these crops non-profitable to Abstract | Fertigation is the application of dissolved fertilizer especially nitrogen through irrigation for correcting nutrient deficiencies of plants.A field study was conducted in Tandojam for two consecutive years in autumn 2018 and 2019.The experiment was replicated thrice in randomized complete block design.Different doses of nitrogen as broadcasting and fertigation (0, 75, 100, 125 kg N ha -1 in two and three equal splits given at sowing time, 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd irrigations, respectively) were applied to two sunflower genotypes (HO-1 and Hysun-39).Data analysis revealed nitrogen fertigation, genotypes and their interaction substantially (P?0.05)affected growth and yield traits of sunflower.Greater seed yield (kg ha -1 ) and the oil content (%) were documented in N 10 = 125 kg N ha -1 : three splits (? broadcasting at sowing time + fertigation-? at 1 st and ? at 3 rd irrigation), followed by N 8 = 125 kg N ha -1 : two splits (½ broadcasting at sowing time + ½ as fertigation at 2 nd irrigation).In between genotypes, higher seed yield (kg ha -1 ) and oil content (%) were recorded in HO-1 as compared to Hysun-39.As regards interactions, enhanced seed yield (kg ha -1 ) and oil content (%) were registered in the interaction of N 10 = 125 kg N ha -1 : three splits (? broadcast at sowing time + fertigation-? at 1 st and ? at 3 rd irrigation) × HO-1.It was concluded from the results that nitrogen dose should be divided into three splits and applied at sowing time through broadcasting and fertigated at 1 st and 2 nd irrigation, respectively."
Molecular Mechanisms of Plant Development and Regulation,,,,,"""Plant Stress Response Genomics || This topic explores the effects of various environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, and magnesium deficiency, on the molecular responses of different plants, including sugarcane, peach, physic nut, date palm, petunia, banana, peanut, and cotton. Focusing on transcriptome and RNA sequencing, it delves into how these stresses impact gene expression in leaves and roots, shedding light on the plants' adaptive mechanisms and resilience against challenging environmental conditions.""",Transcripts and MicroRNAs Responding to Salt Stress in Musa acuminata Colla (AAA Group) cv. Berangan Roots,"Physiological responses to stress are controlled by expression of a large number of genes, many of which are regulated by microRNAs. Since most banana cultivars are salt-sensitive, improved understanding of genetic regulation of salt induced stress responses in banana can support future crop management and improvement in the face of increasing soil salinity related to irrigation and climate change. In this study we focused on determining miRNA and their targets that respond to NaCl exposure and used transcriptome sequencing of RNA and small RNA from control and NaCl-treated banana roots to assemble a cultivar-specific reference transcriptome and identify orthologous and Musa-specific miRNA responding to salinity. We observed that, banana roots responded to salinity stress with changes in expression for a large number of genes (9.5% of 31,390 expressed unigenes) and reduction in levels of many miRNA, including several novel miRNA and banana-specific miRNA-target pairs. Banana roots expressed a unique set of orthologous and Musa-specific miRNAs of which 59 respond to salt stress in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression patterns of miRNA compared with those of their predicted mRNA targets indicated that a majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs were down-regulated in response to increased salinity, allowing increased expression of targets involved in diverse biological processes including stress signaling, stress defence, transport, cellular homeostasis, metabolism and other stress-related functions. This study may contribute to the understanding of gene regulation and abiotic stress response of roots and the high-throughput sequencing data sets generated may serve as important resources related to salt tolerance traits for functional genomic studies and genetic improvement in banana."
Genetic and Agricultural Studies of Sugarcane,,,,,"Sugar Beet Cultivation Research || Studies across various locations in Egypt focus on assessing the effects of water stress, fertilization methods, planting techniques, and additives like alga extract on the growth, yield, and sugar content of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Experiments cover factors like irrigation levels, organic versus mineral fertilizers, drought tolerance of different beet varieties, and soil fertility impacts. The overall goal is to enhance sugar beet productivity and quality under environmental stresses and agricultural management practices.",Root and Sucrose Yields of Sugarbeets as Affected by Mid- to Late-Season Water Stress,"Investigations of the irrigation water requirement of sugarbeets(Beta vulgaris L.) in Arizona and California have shownthat water stress several weeks before harvest of fall-planted beetsreduces root yields but increases sucrose concentration (2,3).Their studies showed that, since soil and plant water stress latein the season did not significantly reduce sucrose production,irrigations could be discontinued 3 to 4 weeks before harvest formaximum water economy. Mid- to late-season water deficit studieson spring-planted sugarbeets at this Center in 1977 and 1978clearly showed that sucrose yield was reduced very little in thisarea, if at all, if irrigations were discontinued after the soilprofile was filled with water about 1 August or 10 to 12 weeksbefore harvest, on soil having a useable soil water reservoir ofat least 200 mm (1) . However, if no rainfall occurs, a lightirrigation about 1 month after water cutoff may be advantageous.The major difference between these two areas (Arizona-Californiaand Idaho) is that in Arizona and California, potential evapotranspirationrates are higher and increasing when fall-plantedbeets are harvested; whereas in Idaho, potential rates are lowerand decreasing when spring-planted beets are harvested. Allowingmid- to late-season water stress to develop in the Idaho areareduces irrigation water requirements by about 30% during August,September, and October when irrigation water and hydro-electricpower for pumping are in shortest supply. Other recent investigationsalso show the drought tolerance of sugarbeets throughoutthe growing season ( 8, 11)."

Research includes the effects of sowing dates, irrigation methods, nutrient management, and the impact of phosphorus and sulfur fertilizers on yield traits. Experiments took place across diverse locations from Ethiopia to India, addressing challenges such as water scarcity, soil fertility, and optimizing agronomic practices for improved bean cultivation.",EFFECT OF SPRINKLER IRRIGATION AND COOLING ON YIELD AND QUALITY OF SNAP BEANS,"High temperatures and dry soil conditions that frequently occur in southern Alberta during July and August may cause objectionably high fiber content of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). During the period 1968–71, the response of bean yield and quality to cooling by low-volume sprinkler irrigation during hot weather at the time of pod development was studied. Low-volume sprinkling for cooling prevented undesirable fiber formation and alleviated, to some extent, soil moisture stress. Where soil moisture was returned to field capacity by irrigation at 7- to 10-day intervals, yield and quality also remained high without low-volume sprinkler cooling. Thus, under Alberta conditions, excess fiber formation appears to be closely related to the amount of available soil moisture and can be avoided by proper irrigation with conventional methods."

Factors Influencing Fruit Ripening and Quality,,,,,"Tomato Growth and Irrigation Studies || This topic covers extensive research on the cultivation of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), focusing on different aspects such as grafting, irrigation techniques (including partial-root zone drying, deficit irrigation, and drip irrigation), fertilizer rates, and other growing conditions. Investigations include the impact of these variables on tomato yield, water-use efficiency, fruit quality, and the management of environmental factors like soil quality and water salinity. The studies aim to find sustainable and efficient agricultural practices for enhancing tomato production under various environmental conditions.","Combined Effects of Irrigation Regime, Genotype, and Harvest Stage Determine Tomato Fruit Quality and Aptitude for Processing into Puree","Industry tomatoes are produced under a range of climatic conditions and practices which significantly impact on main quality traits of harvested fruits. However, the quality of tomato intended for processing is currently addressed on delivery through color and Brix only, whereas other traits are overlooked. Very few works provided an integrated view of the management of tomato puree quality throughout the chain. To gain insights into pre- and post-harvest interactions, four genotypes, two water regimes, three maturity stages, and two processes were investigated. Field and glasshouse experiments were conducted near Avignon, France, from May to August 2016. Two irrigation regimes were applied: control plants were irrigated in order to match 100% of evapotranspiration (ETP); water deficit (WD) plants were irrigated as control plants until anthesis of the first flowers, then irrigation was reduced to 60 and 50% ETP in field, and glasshouse respectively. Fruits were collected at three stages during ripening. Their color, fresh weight, dry matter content, and metabolite contents were determined before processing. Pericarp cell size was evaluated in glasshouse only. Two laboratory-scaled processing methods were applied before structural and biochemical analyses of the purees. Results outlined interactive effects between crop and process management. WD hardly reduced yield, but increased dry matter content in the field, in contrast to the glasshouse. The puree viscosity strongly depended on the genotype and the maturity stage, but it was disconnected from fruit dry matter content or Brix. The process impact on puree viscosity strongly depended on water supply during fruit production. Moreover, the lycopene content of fresh fruit may influence puree viscosity. This work opens new perspectives for managing puree quality in the field showing that it was possible to reduce water supply without affecting yield and to improve puree quality."

In this sense, the objective was to evaluate the physiological and flowering responses of ornamentalsunflower depending on the application of silicon and irrigation with saline water. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in a completely randomized design with six replications, in a 4 x 5 factorial scheme, referring to four electrical conductivities of irrigation water (ECw): 0.5; 1.5; 2.5 and 3.5 dS m-1 and silicon doses: 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg L-1, with potassium silicate as the source. The following were evaluated: internal carbon concentration, transpiration, rate of liquid photosynthesis, instant efficiency of carboxylation, leaf indexes of chlorophyll a, b, chlorophyll a/b ratio, total chlorophyll, external and internal diameter of the chapter, number of petals, appearance of floral bud, beginning of flowering and full opening of the floral bud. Salinity negatively affects photosynthetic activity and flowering of ornamental sunflower plants, so that plants irrigated with saline water (3.5 dS m-1) delayed the appearance of the flower bud, the flowering index and the total opening of the floral button. The application of silicon in ornamental sunflower plants is not effective to mitigate the deleterious effects of salinity on the plant’s physiology. In addition, the addition of silicon is also not able to repair the losses in terms of flowering caused by salt stress in the species."

The plots were irrigated at a level to meet the evapotranspiration demand for maximum forage yield. The effect on future yields of harvesting once in the establishment year (approx. 15) was established by determining forage yields for 4, 4, 3, 2 and 2 yr subsequent to the establishment year, respectively. Establishment year harvesting reduced the subsequent yield of Beaver and Alfa cultivars in the 1976 and 1977 seedings. There were no significant effects in 1978, 1979 and 1981 seedings from establishment year harvesting. It was noted when significant yield reductions did occur in the post-establishment yields that the establishment year yield compensates and the total production of the stand is not affected. Roamer was superior to Beaver which was better than Alfa and Dupuits in winterhardiness at this location. Variation in the significance of establishment year treatments among seeding years indicated that establishment year management trials should be sequently seeded for at least 3 yr to evaluate management × environment interaction effects on perennial crops.Key words: Alfalfa, medicago, cutting, yield, winterkill"

Two identical studies were initiated at the New Mexico State University Rex E. Kirksey Agricultural Science Center at Tucumcari, NM, USA to compare continuous alfalfa (ALF), a single year of rotation to sorghum-sudangrass (SS1; Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf), two years of rotation with sorghum-sudangrass (SS2), and winter wheat forage (Triticum aestivum L.) followed by a single season of sorghum-sudangrass (WW/SS). Soil type and renovation/rotation strategy may influence soil fertility prior to replanting alfalfa, but soil fertility did not appear to influence alfalfa re-establishment or first production year yields. With a Test x Rotation interaction due to differences between tests for WW/SS for first production year yield after September alfalfa replanting, the main effect of Rotation was significant for yield (6.43AB, 5.3B0, 6.92A, and 3.54C Mg ha?1 for ALF, SS1, SS2, and WW/SS, respectively; 5% LSD = 1.22). Alfalfa stand destruction and replanting with no intervening crop rotation may be feasible in sandy soils with irrigation in the semiarid, subtropical southwestern USA and similar environments."

Genomics and Breeding of Peanut,,,,,"Groundnut Stress Tolerance || This topic explores the resilience of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) varieties under various stress conditions, including water scarcity, high temperature, and salinity. It covers research on physiological responses, yield impacts, and quality of seeds produced under stress. Studies focus on evaluating groundnut genotypes (including landraces) in controlled environments like screen houses and rain shelters, aiming to identify traits for drought tolerance and improve water-use efficiency and crop productivity in semi-arid regions.",Assessment of Groundnut under Combined Heat and Drought Stress,"In semi?arid regions, particularly in the Sahel, water and high?temperature stress are serious constraints for groundnut production. Understanding of combined effects of heat and drought on physiological traits, yield and its attributes is of special significance for improving groundnut productivity. Two hundred and sixty?eight groundnut genotypes were evaluated in four trials under both intermittent drought and fully irrigated conditions, two of the trial being exposed to moderate temperature, while the two other trials were exposed to high temperature. The objectives were to analyse the component of the genetic variance and their interactions with water treatment, year and environment (temperature) for agronomic characteristics, to select genotypes with high pod yield under hot? and moderate?temperature conditions, or both, and to identify traits conferring heat and/or drought tolerance. Strong effects of water treatment (Trt), genotype (G) and genotype?by?treatment (GxTrt) interaction were observed for pod yield (Py), haulm yield (Hy) and harvest index (HI). The pod yield decrease caused by drought stress was 72 % at high temperature and 55 % at moderate temperature. Pod yield under well?watered (WW) conditions did not decrease under high?temperature conditions. Haulm yield decrease caused by water stress (WS) was 34 % at high temperature and 42 % under moderate temperature. Haulm yield tended to increase under high temperature, especially in one season. A significant year effect and genotype?by?environment interaction (GxE) effect were also observed for the three traits under WW and WS treatments. The GGE biplots confirmed these large interactions and indicated that high yielding genotypes under moderate temperature were different to those at high temperature. However, several genotypes with relatively high yield across years and temperature environments could be identified under both WW and WS conditions. Correlation analysis between pod weight and traits measured during plant growth showed that the partition rate, that is, the proportion of dry matter partitioned into pods, was contributing in heat and drought tolerance and could be a reliable selection criterion for groundnut breeding programme. Groundnut sensitivity to high?temperature stress was in part related to the sensitivity of reproduction."

The research highlights the importance of biostimulants in combating drought-induced stress by enhancing plant health, potentially leading to sustainable agricultural practices in arid and semi-arid regions.",Biostimulants Application Alleviates Water Stress Effects on Yield and Chemical Composition of Greenhouse Green Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),"The increasing scarcity of water demands proper water management practices to ensure crop sustainability. In this study, the effect of drought stress and biostimulants application on the yield and chemical composition of green pods and seeds of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was evaluated. For this purpose, four commercially available biostimulant products, namely Nomoren (G), EKOprop (EK), Veramin Ca (V), and Twin-Antistress (TW), were tested under two irrigation regimes: normal irrigation (W+) and water-holding (W-) conditions. The highest increase (20.8%) of pods total yield was observed in EKW+ treatment due to the formation of more pods of bigger size compared to control treatment (CW+). In addition, the highest yield under drought stress conditions was recorded for the GW- treatment (5691 ± 139 kg/ha). Regarding the effects of biostimulants on the protein and ash content of pods, the application of VW+ treatment (first harvest of pods; 201 ± 1 and 79 ± 1 g/kg dw for proteins and ash content, respectively) and GW+ (second harvest of pods; 207.1 ± 0.1 and 68.4 ± 0.5 g/kg dw for proteins and ash content, respectively) showed the best results. For seeds, the application of GW+ treatment resulted in the highest content for fat, protein, and ash content (52.7 ± 0.1, 337 ± 1, 56 ± 1 g/kg dw) and energetic value (5474 ± 3 kcal/kg dw). ?-tocopherol was the main detected tocopherol in pods and seeds, and it was significantly increased by the application of TWW- (first harvest of pods; 6410 ± 40 ?g/kg dw), VW- (second harvest of pods; 3500 ± 20 ?g/kg dw), and VW+ (seeds; 39.8 ± 0.1 g/kg dw) treatments. EKW- treatment resulted in the lowest oxalic acid content for both pod harvests (26.3 ± 0.1 g/kg dw and 22.7 ± 0.2 g/kg dw for the first and second harvest of pods, respectively) when compared with the rest of the treatments where biostimulants were applied, although in all the cases, the oxalic acid content was considerably low. Fructose and sucrose were the main sugars detected in pods and seeds, respectively, while the highest content was recorded for the TWW- (first harvest of pods) and GW- (second harvest of pods and seeds) treatments. The main detected fatty acids in pods and seeds were ?-linolenic, linoleic, and palmitic acid, with a variable effect of the tested treatments being observed. In conclusion, the application of biostimulants could be considered as an eco-friendly and sustainable means to increase the pod yield and the quality of common bean green pods and seeds under normal irrigation conditions. Promising results were also recorded regarding the alleviation of negative effects of drought stress, especially for the application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; G treatment), which increased the total yield of green pods. Moreover, the nutritional value and chemical composition of pods and seeds was positively affected by biostimulants application, although a product specific effect was recorded depending on the irrigation regime and harvesting time (pods and seeds)."

Phelipanche aegyptiaca is the most common of the Orobanchaceae species in Israel inflicting heavy damage to a wide range of broadleaf crops, including processing tomatoes. aegyptiaca is extremely difficult to control due to its minute and vast number of seeds and its underground association with host plant roots. The highly efficient attachment of the parasite haustoria into the host phloem and xylem enables the diversion of water, assimilates and minerals from the host into the parasite. Drip irrigation is the most common method of irrigation in processing tomatoes in Israel, but the delivery of herbicides via drip irrigation systems (herbigation) has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of these studies was to test, under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the factors involved in the behavior of soil-herbigated imazapic, and the consequential influence of imazapic on P. aegyptiaca and tomato plants. Dose-response Petri dish studies showed that imazapic does not impede P. aegyptiaca seed germination and non-attached seedlings, even at the high rate of 5000 ppb. Imazapic applied to tomato roots inoculated with P. aegyptiaca seeds in a PE bag system revealed that the parasite is killed only after its attachment to the tomato roots, at concentrations as low as 2.5 ppb. Imazapic sorption curves and calculated Kd and Koc values indicated that the herbicide Kd is similar in all soils excluding a two-fold higher coefficient in the Gadash farm soil, while the Koc was similar in all soils except the Eden farm soil, in which it was more than twofold lower. In greenhouse studies, control of P. aegyptiaca was achieved at 2.5 ppb imazapic, but adequate control requires repeated applications due to the 7-day half-life (t1/2) of the herbicide in the soil. Tracking of imazapic in soil and tomato roots revealed that the herbicide accumulates in the tomato host plant roots, but its movement to newly formed roots is limited. The data obtained in the laboratory and greenhouse studies provide invaluable knowledge for devising field imazapic application strategies via drip irrigation systems for efficient and selective broomrape control."

The experimental trial was conducted in Southern Italy (Apulia region) for two cropping cycles (GS1 and GS2) using ‘Violetto di Provenza’ as cultivar. The artichoke heads were analyzed for proximate composition (dry matter, total sugar, total fat, ash, and total protein), percentage of edible part, mineral profile (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, copper, iron, nickel, zinc, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and sulphate) and polyphenolic acids content (caffeoylquinic acids and flavones). Both SW and TW treatments caused an increase of the percentage of the edible part, head protein contents, and mineral elements of the main and processing heads. Moreover, SW statistically increased the caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and the trans-ferulic acid content, while both SW and TW the flavones content. Finally, according to the multivariate analysis adopted, in our experimental conditions, the mineral component of the heads, such as chloride, potassium, copper, and zinc content, had a greater weight in the separation of FW, SW, and TW. On the other hand, the polyphenolic 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid had a greater weight in the separation of the head class groups (main, secondary, and processing). Moreover, the trans-ferulic acid content of the heads was related both to the irrigation water type and to the different head classes."

Despite the abundant research on fire blight, information about E. amylovora population dynamics and survival in fire blight cankers and the plant defense responses to this pathogen in the infected bark are limited. In our study, we obtained fire blight cankers in apple, pear, and Asian pear cultivars showing differing resistance to the disease by shoot inoculation with E. We collected cankers from irrigated and non-irrigated trees every 3 months in two independent field experiments and analyzed samples by viability digital PCR. We also assessed the expression of pathogenicity-related ( PR ) genes in the bark of selected apple and Asian pear cultivars. A logistic regression analysis revealed the impact of environmental and host factors on E. amylovora detection rates in cankers. The chances of detecting live E. amylovora cells in cankers increased significantly in those collected from irrigated trees, in July, and/or during an experiment performed in a year with an expected average rainfall when compared to samples from non-irrigated trees, collected in January, and/or during an experiment performed under environmental conditions dominated by drought. We found a positive correlation between the pathogen detection rates in cankers and the host resistance to fire blight that might be explained by lower E. amylovora survival rates in more damaged tissues of susceptible hosts. The genes PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and PR-8 were induced in the bark surrounding apple and Asian pear fire blight cankers. Our study, involving the analysis of more than 800 canker samples, provides new knowledge about the fire blight disease cycle and lays the foundation for improved fire blight management and eradication strategies in pome fruit orchards."

Leaf Aqueous Extract on Seed Yield and Fibre Quality of Linseed under Water Deficit Stress,"Moringa oleifera leaf extract contains active ingredients with stimulatory effects on natural processes of plants like uptake of nutrients, photosynthesis, biomass production and flowering. Therefore, we conducted field experiments to determine the effects of M. oleifera leaf aqueous extract (MLAE) on growth and fibre quality of three linseed varieties viz. Roshni, BL1 and Chandni under water deficit stress for two years. Water deficit stress was imposed during tillering growth phase (60 days after sowing) by skipping four irrigations, keeping 40% soil field capacity. The MLAE (5%) was applied to leaves once before the start of water deficit stress period and next 15 days after imposition of water deficit stress. Analysis of MLAE showed the presence of natural phenolics (150 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/mL extract) and essential nutrients like Ca, Mg, K, Zn, Mn, and Fe. Positive impact of the MLAE was observed on plant height, tillers production, leaf chlorophyll pigments, phenolics content, sugars content, seed yield and fibre quality of linseed both under non-stress and water deficit stress. Our studies concluded that MLAE can be a probable approach for maintaining normal growth and fibre quality of linseed plants under short supply of water."

Sixty web-blight-damaged azalea plants (‘Gumpo White’) were collected in August 2005 and 2006 and arranged in a completely randomized design on an outdoor irrigation pad. A nylon mesh bag containing 30 necrotic leaves collected from web-blight-damaged ‘Gumpo White’ azalea plants were placed on the surface of the medium under the plant canopy in each container to simulate leaf litter. Ten plants were destructively sampled into eight zones by dividing stems into three zones (lengths of 0 to 2, 4 to 6, and 9 to 15 cm above the medium surface), bagged leaves into one leaf litter zone, and the medium into four zones (three horizontal layers: 1 to 3, 3 to 7, and 7 to 10 cm below the medium surface, with the middle layer further divided by removing the central 7.5-cm-diameter core) in December, February, and May. Only the three stem zones were sampled from 10 plants in early and late June and late July. Of 8,940 total isolations, 3,655 fungi with morphological characteristics of a Rhizoctonia sp. were recovered. Percent recovery differed from the eight zones (P 0.0001) but did not differ between years (P = 0.3950) and sampling times (P = 0.1896). Frequency of recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. was highest from the lower stem and the leaf litter, and decreased with distance from the leaf litter. Recovery from stems over the six sample times was analyzed separately. Percent recovery differed between stem zones (P 0.0001), sample times (P = 0.0478), and experiment years (P 0.0001). In both years, mean recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. was higher from the lower stem and decreased with distance to the upper stem layer. From a subsample of 145 isolates, 95.1% were identified as binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) anastomosis groups (AGs)-A, -G, -K, -R, -S, and -U (-P), and 2.8 and 2.1% were Rhizoctonia solani AG-2 and an uncultured Laetisaria sp., respectively. Based on frequency analysis, recovery of BNR AGs differed by plant zone (P 0.0001) but not over sample times (P = 0.4831). The six AGs of BNR are the predominant Rhizoctonia fungi occupying the habitat niches in container-grown azalea, with little change in population frequency and composition from fall to summer; thus, BNR pathogenic and nonpathogenic to azalea have established a mixed Rhizoctonia community on container-grown azalea."

Crude protein (CP) and crude fibre (CF) of forages were higher (P 0.05) in treatment with 20 kgP/ha and 40 kgP/ha compared to the control. SAMPEA 14 forage resulted in significantly higher (P 0.05) mean CP of 16.91% compared to SAMPEA 15 with 15.74%. The CP of SAMPEA 14 forage increased by 6.91% compared to SAMPEA 15 forage. Mean P increased by 11% with SAMPEA 14 comapred to SAMPEA 15. Calcium and potassium were higher (P 0.05) in treatment with 5 days irrigation frequencies compared to 15 days irrigation interval. Phosphorus application rates showed an increasing trend (P 0.05) in P determined with 40 kgP/ha application level in 2018 dry season. It is therefore, concluded that, farmers should irrigate SAMPEA 14 using the 5-day irrigation frequency in combination with 20 kgP/ha of phosphorus application rate for optimum fodder quality."
Regulation of Seed Dormancy and Germination,,,,,"Salinity Tolerance in Plants || This topic explores the impact of salinity, particularly from NaCl and saline water, on various landscape and ornamental plants.

The aim is to identify plants with high salinity tolerance for sustainable landscaping in salty conditions.","RESPONSE OF TEPHROSIA PURPUREA L. TO SALINITY STRESS IN RELATION TO GERMINATION, CAROTENOID CONTENT AND PROLINE CONTENT","Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting profitable crop production. The effect of salt stress on germination,carotenoid and proline content of Tephrosia purpurea was investigated Three different salinity level (50,100 and 200 mM)were used for germination experiment and distilled water as control. For pot experiment plants were treated with four different NaCl concentration (50,100,200,300mM).Normally irrigated plants were treated as control. Observations were recorded from day 25 up to day 65 at ten days interval. Result indicated that lower salt concentration (50mM) enhance seed germination but beyond it germination decreases. The result show that salinity increase carotenoid and proline content. The increase of proline with salinity increase shows the importance of the osmotic balance in low water potential condition. In general the results of the experiments showed that increase in production of proline as an osmotic regulatory mechanism for survival in high salinity levels."

The studies employ advanced techniques like 16S rRNA metabarcoding to unravel how these microbial communities influence plant health, nutrient cycling, and soil quality, contributing to sustainable agricultural systems.",Bacterial community composition of bulk soil from date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) farm depend on irrigation water salinity,"Non-saline and saline ground water irrigation is extensively used in the arid regions of United Arab Emirates (UAE) for date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) cultivation without knowing its effect on bulk soil bacterial communities. Bulk soil acts as a supply base for microbes and nutrients that are accessed by date palm roots. We collected soil samples from date farms across UAE and performed V3-V4 16s rRNA metabarcoding analysis to understand how bulk soil bacterial diversity and communities respond to irrigation water sources (non-saline and saline groundwater irrigation). There was no significant variation in bulk bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity, richness as well as evenness). But bulk bacterial communities differed between irrigation water sources and irrigation water electrical conductivity was the significant factor that explained a part of community variation. Out of total 5089 OTUs, saline bulk soil harbored only 21.3% of total OTUs compared to 31.5% OTUs in non-saline bulk soil, while 47.15% OTUs shared between both types of irrigation. Proteobacteria abundance was higher in saline bulk soil, while Actinobacteriota abundance was enhanced in non-saline bulk soil. Similar selection was observed at genus level, wherein saline bulk soil showed increase in abundance of Subgroup_10, Nitrospira and Mycobacterium, whereas Microvirga, Ammoniphilus, Nitrospira and Lysinibacillus were elevated in non-saline bulk soil. Saline (Novibacillus and Bauldea) and non-saline bulk soil (Microvirga, Marmoricola, Domibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Bhargavaea and Solirubrobacter) showed significant selection of indicator taxa (P 0.05). This indicate that bacterial communities colonizing bulk soil differ depending on irrigation water source and it is affected by irrigation water EC."

The evaluation of wheat validity or its suitability for the bread production as well as the quality of the resulted bread, depends on its flour characterizations and character of formed dough as well as on quality of the resulted bread. Three water treatments were applied as follows: 500, 400, 300 ml on seven varieties and five promising lines of bread wheat selected at ICARDA. After the harvest and getting the productivity, the protein and Farinograph test were assessed. Response of varieties and lines differed, depending on the water treatments. Also in the same water treatment the productivity varied among them clearly, but not associated with any of the studied technological indicators. A correlation relation between the percentage of protein and the irrigation rate, as well as between the Farinograph development time (FDT) and Farinograph Mixing Tolerance (FMT), was observed. Quality of the dough varied according to studied plant material and also by applied water treatment. Plant material studied was divided into four groups: two groups of them characterized weak dough to medium strength which were suitable for the Arabic bread, and other two characterized by strong dough to very strong which, were more suitable for French bread."

The collection of research aims at accelerating breeding programs through genomic tools to develop high-performing, biofortified wheat varieties.",Marker Development and Pyramiding of Fhb1 and Fhb7 for Enhanced Resistance to Fusarium Head Blight in Soft Red Winter Wheat,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating fungal disease of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Several genetic loci were previously identified that control FHB resistance in wheat, including Fhb1. Fhb7, a major QTL conferring resistance to FHB, controlling for mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) production, has been introgressed into soft red winter wheat (SRWW). As an exotic QTL, Fhb7 is associated with linkage drag, affecting agronomic and end-use quality performance. This study outlines a breeding strategy for introducing and pyramiding Fhb7 into SRWW breeding populations that already possessed Fhb1 and harbored some additional disease-resistance genes. In addition to the Fhb1-Fhb7 pyramiding, we developed gene-based markers for both genes and examined them on 57 SRWW breeding lines. Our data showed that 15 out of 57 breeding lines possessed both Fhb1 and Fhb7 resistant alleles. Two years of phenotypic data from the inoculated and misted irrigation field showed that the combination of Fhb1-Fhb7 lowers mycotoxin DON accumulation in kernels, which provides protection for end-users and the milling industry. The Fhb gene-pyramided lines, with the additional regionally important disease resistance genes, produced in this breeding pipeline showed reasonable agronomic traits and can be used in crossing programs for the widespread introgression in elite wheat cultivars."

Currently, however, information regarding tomato cultivar performance in high tunnels is lacking. We conducted a tomato cultivar trial in an 1800-ft 2 plastic-covered high tunnel in Durham, NH, with 15 indeterminate cultivars using organic fertilizers and pesticides. Tomatoes were grown in-ground in a randomized complete block design (n = 4) using raised beds with plastic mulch and drip irrigation. Marketable and unmarketable yield, several yield components, and susceptibility to two common diseases, leaf mold ( Fulvia fulva ) and powdery mildew ( Oidium lycopersici or Leveillula taurica ), were evaluated over a 3-year period. Differences between cultivars existed in all areas of interest, and year-to-year variation in performance was noteworthy in this experiment. ‘Geronimo’ consistently had among the highest yields, ‘Arbason’ and ‘Massada’ produced many individual fruit, and several cultivars including Rebelski, Massada, and Geronimo showed no signs of disease. Some cultivars such as Conestoga appeared susceptible to several different physiological disorders while others were relatively robust against this type of marketable yield reduction. Because we assessed multiple yield and quality variables and observed apparent trade-offs in several of these, we used radar plots to summarize and communicate the performance of each cultivar in an intuitive and comparable manner. Based on these data, several tomato cultivars appear particularly well suited for high tunnel production in northern New England."

Although specialty crops compose the majority of the state’s crops in both economic value and land area, the portion of GHG emissions contributed by them is still highly uncertain. Current and emerging soil management practices affect the mitigation of those emissions. Herein, we review the scientific literature on the impact of soil management practices in California specialty crop systems on GHG nitrous oxide emissions. As such studies from most major specialty crop systems in California are limited, we focus on two annual and two perennial crops with the most data from the state: tomato, lettuce, wine grapes and almond. Nitrous oxide emission factors were developed and compared to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors, and state-wide emissions for these four crops were calculated for specific soil management practices. Dependent on crop systems and specific management practices, the emission factors developed in this study were either higher, lower or comparable to IPCC emission factors. Uncertainties caused by low gas sampling frequency in these studies were identified and discussed. These uncertainties can be remediated by robust and standardized estimates of nitrous oxide emissions from changes in soil management practices in California specialty crop systems. Promising practices to reduce nitrous oxide emissions and meet crop production goals, pertinent gaps in knowledge on this topic and limitations of this approach are discussed."

It has achieved this over a period of significant change in ownership, with the transfer of at least 25 per cent of land growing sugar cane into black community ownership through South Africa's land reform programme. The industry now claims that the majority of land used for sugar cane in Nkomazi is owned by the beneficiaries of land reform. This paper examines the historical and contemporary trajectories of sugar cane production in Nkomazi, focusing particularly on the changing status of production on black-owned land. Among small-scale growers, a crisis in operation and maintenance of irrigation has prompted on the one hand a process of land concentration and 'accumulation from below', visible in the emergence of medium-scale growers, and, on the other hand, a move by the sugar milling company to take more direct control of sugar cane growing through rental agreements with small-scale landowners. The latter draws on recent experience of 'joint-venture' sugar cane production on land transferred to black 'community trusts' under the government's land restitution programme. The paper argues that the moves to medium- and large-scale farming are consistent with the changing livelihoods and aspirations of black South Africans since the end of apartheid, but also suggests contradictions between the emergence of black capitalist medium-scale farmers on the one hand and extension of corporate control of production on the other. While corporate agriculture offers advantages to some, in particular farm employees and a small number of black-owned contractors, it appears to offer little benefit to the majority of African 'landowners' while potentially blocking the further expansion of medium-scale growers."

Czern.]. The experiment consisted of 3 irrigation levels (I1, control; I2, one irrigation at 40 DAS; I3, two irrigations at 40 and 75 DAS), and two varieties (V1, RH-725; V2, RH-749) in main plots, whereas, 4 anti-transpirants (A1, control; A2, PMA @250 ppm at 45 and 90 DAS; A3, 6% kaolin at 45 and 90 DAS and A4, PMA @250 ppm + 6% kaolin at 45 and 90 DAS) in sub plots. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with 3 replications. The results revealed that different irrigation levels and anti-transpirants significantly influenced the performance of RH-749 and RH-725 mustard varieties. Yield attributes such as number of siliquae/plant, siliquae length, number of seeds per siliquae, test weight, seed yield/plant and biological yield were recorded significantly higher during both the years. Whereas, in the case of anti-transpirants, highest biological yield and productivity per day of mustard was recorded in A4 as compared to A1 but it was at par with A3 anti-transpirants. Among the varieties, RH-749 performed better compared to RH-725 under different treatments. The interactive between I3 irrigation level and A4 anti-transpirants was significantly superioras compared to others. Moreover, mustard yield was found significant and positively correlated with different yield attributes."

Taxco de Alarcón, Guerrero, in southern Mexico has had a WWTP operating since 2016, and the SS disposal is a task that must be addressed by the WWTP. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth capacity of Panicum maximum, also known as mombaza grass (MG), by using SS generated within the ""Taxco de Alarcón wastewater treatment plant"" as substrate. To do so, 4 g of MG seeds were scattered over 5 kg (dry basis) of SS. As a control, a commercial compost soil was used, hereafter called pattern soil (PS). The experiment was carried out in triplicates for three months and drinking water (water used for human consumption) was used for crop irrigation. Each month a MG harvest was carried out. The response variables analyzed for MG were germination time (one month after plant emergence), height (HMG), growth rate GrMG, and yield (YMG), whereas in the SS and PS the content of organic matter was analyzed. Furthermore, the chemical composition was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) on the MG, SS, and PS. The results showed that MG germinated faster on PS (5 days) than germination on SS (7 days). However, the MG grown on SS reached a considerably higher height (45 cm) compared to the height reached on PS (17 cm). Furthermore, the maximum GrMG over SS was also higher than the maximum GrMG observed on the PS, 3.64 and 1.40 cm?day-1, respectively. In terms of YMG, it was observed that on SS it reached an average monthly YMG of 416 g?m-2, whereas in PS it reached a YMG of 72 g?m-2. The chemical analysis detected P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, considered macronutrients in both substrates. Besides, some micronutrients identified in SS were Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, whereas in PS it was also possible to detect micronutrients except Mn and Zn. All the macronutrients detected in the substrates were observed in the harvested MG. However, in the MG harvested in PS, Mn and Zn were not detected. Hence, a feasible disposal strategy for the SS generated by the Taxco de Alarcón WWTP is as a substrate for grass forage MG by its high organic matter content, the significant presence of macro and micronutrients, and the performance shown by MG cultivated in SS. Furthermore, the SS characteristics provide added value and can be considered as organic amendments of agricultural soils."

According to A.E., Fersman [11], when the ion radii differ by up to 20%, cations are considered interchangeable, in other words, isomorphic in the crystal lattices of minerals, which is why when irrigating with mineralized water, sodium ions replace Mg++ and Ca++ ions. This substitution occurs gradually and over a long period the influence of mineralized waters and at a certain stage quantitatively stabilizes. In order to predict the probability of the sodium cation entering the SAC, and therefore the potential danger of soil alkalinization during irrigation with mineralized waters, a special indicator SAR (Sodium adsorption ratio) is used, which, based on Ca ++, Mg ++, Na data, makes it possible to assess the quality of irrigation water. Our waters, both river and mineralized, had a low risk of salinization and alkalinization according to this indicator, and therefore, when they were used as irrigation water, they did not render the soil unusable for a short period of 3-10 years, i.e. in terms of solonetzization, there were no significant changes, the soils were not solonetzic and remained so. But the process of solonetzization took place."
Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Research,,,,,"Cucumber Cultivation Techniques || This topic encompasses various studies and experiments conducted on cucumber, scientifically known as Cucumis sativus, focusing on the analysis and optimization of growth conditions. Covered aspects include drought and ozone stress, fertigation levels, irrigation regimes, hydraulic performance under different land slopes, and the impact of deficit irrigation on cucumber yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Experiments were carried out in a variety of settings, such as greenhouses, poly houses, and open fields, across different geographical locations, providing insights into efficient cucumber cultivation practices tailored to specific environmental conditions.",Effect of Moisture Depletion on Gynoecious Cucumber Genotypes and Water Consumption Estimation,"The study was carried out in the College of Agriculture, University of Anbar, in the fall agricultural season for the year 2022. A factorial experiment of two factors was designed according to the arrangement of the split plots according to the randomized complete block design with three replicate, The first factor included two levels of moisture depletion, 25 and 50% of the water available to the plant, calculated according to the weight method, and placed in the main plots, and the second factor included 5 genotypes With a sixth hybrid to compare (Kanz), placed in the sub plots, Drip irrigation was used in the irrigation of the experiment using GR tubes with a drainage of 3.2 liters h ?1 . The results of the study showed that moisture depletion exceeded 25% in the characteristics of plant height, number of nodes, number of fruits, and plant yield, as it reached 288.04 cm and 31.07 nodes Plant ?1 42.23 fruits Plant ?1 3.68 kg Plant ?1 , respectively, while moisture depletion recorded 50% 252.59 cm. And 26.98 nodes Plant ?1 37.69 fruit plant ?1 3.15 kg plant ?1 , respectively, for the same characteristics. While the depletion exceeded 50% in the early yield, reaching 1.313 kg plant ?1 . We conclude from the experiment that the best genotypes were the 4×1 hybrid and irrigation at the level of 25% depletion was the best in all traits except early in yield."
Risk Management and Vulnerability in Agriculture,,,,,"Climate Change on Agriculture || This topic explores the effects of climate change on agricultural systems worldwide, with a focus on different regions including Pakistan, Italy, Peru, southern African region, South Asia, Nepal, and Mexico. Studies highlight vulnerabilities due to temperature increases, precipitation changes, and extreme weather conditions, assessing impacts on crop production, water resources, and economic outcomes for farms. Adaptation strategies and the importance of water management in sustaining agricultural productivity are also discussed, showcasing the global challenge of securing food and water resources under changing climatic conditions.",The economic impact of climate change on Kenyan crop agriculture: A Ricardian approach,"This paper measures the economic impact of climate on crops in Kenya. We use cross-sectional data on climate, hydrological, soil and household level data for a sample of 816 households. We estimate a seasonal Ricardian model to assess the impact of climate on net crop revenue per acre. The results show that climate affects crop productivity. There is a non-linear relationship between temperature and revenue on one hand and between precipitation and revenue on the other. Estimated marginal impacts suggest that global warming is harmful for crop productivity. Predictions from global circulation models confirm that global warming will have a substantial impact on net crop revenue in Kenya. The results also show that the temperature component of global warming is much more important than precipitation. Findings call for monitoring of climate change and dissemination of information to farmers to encourage adaptations to climate change. Improved management and conservation of available water resources, water harvesting and recycling of wastewater could generate water for irrigation purposes especially in the arid and semi-arid areas."
