Paper Title: Cucumber cultivation technology using tunnel covers
Paper Abstract: Obtaining early cucumber production in the Volgograd region sharp-continental climate with frequent early spring frosts is possible only with using tunnel covers. A distinctive feature of the considered technology is cucumber cultivation using tunnel covers with insulated zone organization by making cracks in the soil with filling them with straw. This provides the comfortable conditions creation for the plants preservation when there is a sharp drop in air and soil temperature in spring and a possible return of spring frosts. Maintaining soil moisture in the 0,5 m layer at the level of 90% of the lowest moisture capacity by drip irrigation allowed to obtain a cucumber yield at the level of 85,9 t/ha, which is 7,8 t/ha more than in the basic option.
