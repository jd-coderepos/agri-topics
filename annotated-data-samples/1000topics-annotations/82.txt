Paper Title: Performance of newly developed faba bean (Vicia faba) varieties in different agro-ecological condition of Eastern India
Paper Abstract: Two varieties, the Swarana Suraksha and Swarana Gaurav of faba bean (Vicia faba L.), developed at ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna; were evaluated against check variety Vikrant, for its suitability under different agro-ecological conditions of Eastern region of India. Performance evaluations were done at multilocation in eastern Indo Gangetic plains of Bihar; semiarid saline condition of Uttar Pradesh and in the acidic condition of hills and plateau region of Jharkhand. The multiplication testing was conducted during 2013-14 to 2015-16. Significantly higher yields of 3.03 t/ha and 4.32 t/ha were recorded with Swarana Suraksha while 2.31 t/ha and 4.91 t/ha for Swarana Gaurav under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively. Location wise significantly maximum seed yield of 3.61 t/ha was recorded at IARI, Pusa and the corresponding minimum of 2.33 t/ha was recorded at ICAR Ranchi centre. Individually, under irrigated condition, Swarana Gaurav produced significantly higher yield of 5.57 t/ha at IARI, Pusa. Swarana Suraksha was found suitable for both, rainfed and irrigated conditions; whereas Swarana Gaurav was suitable for irrigated condition. These two varieties are already been notified by the Cenral Varietal Release Committee for its cultivation in Bihar; but both the varieties could be recommended for its cultivation in Eastern states. Currently, both the developed varieties are under multiplication at ICAR Research complex for Eastern Region, Patna, right from 2015-16 onwards to introduce in seed chain by 2020-21.
