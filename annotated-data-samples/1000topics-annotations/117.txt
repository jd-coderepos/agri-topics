Paper Title: Soil Chemical and Enzyme Activity after Irrigation with Diluted Winery Wastewater in the Vineyard at Stellenbosch, Western Cape Province
Paper Abstract: This study assessed the effect of diluted WWW and raw water on soil chemical parameters including pH, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na), and soil enzyme activities including ?-glucosidase, phosphatase, and urease, where different summer catch crops were cultivated over one season.The experimental design was a complete randomized block design (CRBD) with 3 replications.After the application of diluted WWW and raw water over one season, there was a significant impact in soil pH in the 0-15 cm soil layer.In the 15-30 cm soil layer, the significant impact was on soil pH and K. Results showed that irrigation with either diluted WWW or raw water had no significant effect on the three soil enzymes throughout the study period.Thus, irrigation with diluted WWW may not adversely affect soil microbial population, ecosystem, and nutrient cycle.
