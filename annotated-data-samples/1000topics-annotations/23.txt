Paper Title: Relative abundance and diversity of Odonata in an irrigated rice field of Madurai, Tamil Nadu
Paper Abstract: A total of 12 taxa of odonata of nine Anisoptera and three Zygoptera were recorded during kharif 2000 in an irrigated rice field of Madurai.Among anisopterans, four species, Pantala flavescens (Fabricius), Diplocodes trivialis (Rambur), Crocothemis servilia (Drury) and Tramea limbata (Desjardins) were dominant.Among zygopterans, Agriocnemis femina femina Brauer was the dominant species recorded in weeded and partially weeded ecosystems.The four species of dragonflies and one species of damselfly had comparatively more abundance in partially weeded rice ecosystem than in weeded rice ecosystem.Rare species like Orthetrum sabina (Drury), Rhyothemis variegata (Linnaeus), Neurothemis tullia (Drury), Anax guttatus (Burmeister) and Trithemis sp. with fewer individuals occurred only at the tillering stage of crop growth.
