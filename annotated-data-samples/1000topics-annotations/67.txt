Paper Title: Control of Sweetpotato Whitefly, Tomato Pinworm, and American Serpentine Leafminer on Staked Tomato, Fall 1991
Paper Abstract: Twelve, 3 ft by 240 ft beds on 6 ft centers were planted with ÔSunnyÕ tomatoes spaced 20 inches apart on 22 Oct. Standard cultural practices were followed for staked, seep-irrigated tomatoes in southwest Florida. Dipel 2 X was applied as needed for control of armyworms. Experimental design was randomized complete block with 4 replications. Each block consisted of 3 rows with each replicate plot comprised of 3 rows 23 ft in length. There were 10 treatments plus an unsprayed control. Five weekly applications were made, beginning on 5 Dec. A single boom plot sprayer equipped with drops fitted with Albuz ATR lilac ceramic tips was operated at 400 psi. Each drop had 3 nozzles, for a total of 6 per row. Average delivery per nozzle was 0.194 gal/min; total delivery rate was 54 gal/acre. SPWF and LM immatures, LM stings, and completed mines were monitored weekly with a random sampling of 3 terminal leaflets from three 6th Leaves (from the top) per plot, 1 per row. Leaf area was determined with a leaf area meter to obtain values for SPWF per cm2. Adult SPWF were counted from one, 3-inch sq yellow card trap exposed for 24 hr (one card per row). Fruit was harvested twice, weighted and counted by USDA size categories, culled and checked for TPW damage.
