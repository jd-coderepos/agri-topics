Paper Title: Efficacy of Spinosad and Standards for Control of Small Black Cutworm Larvae, 1997
Paper Abstract: The study was located on bentgrass range 1 north at the Ohio State Turfgrass Research and Education Center, Columbus, OH. Treatments were applied on 19 Aug to plots 4 X 6 ft arranged in a RCB, replicated 4 times. Liquid treatments were applied using a CO2 sprayer calibrated to deliver 2.0 gal/1000ft2. No immediate posttreatment irrigation was applied. The 100% creeping bentgrass range was mowed at 0.5 inch, had no thatch and was irrigated daily with 0.25 inch of water between (05:00 and 06:00). On 19 Aug, one 8-inch stainless steel cylinder was driven into the turf, about 2 hr after the last spraying to allow for complete drying of all treatments. Each cylinder was infested with eight 3rd- and 4th-instar BCW (0.375 to 0.5 inch) and covered with nylon screen. On 22 Aug (3 DAT) the covers were removed and each cylinder was flooded with a soapy water mix (15 ml Joy dishwashing detergent in 1.0 gal water) to flush out any live BCW.
