Paper Title: Selection of Aquatic Plants Having High Uptake Ability of Pollutants in Raw Sewage Treatment
Paper Abstract: Excess runoff contaminated with N and P can impact the quality of downstream water. It has been known that aquatic plants improve the water quality through their intake of organic or inorganic nutrients. This study was conducted to select aquatic plants having high purification ability for nutrient N and P, and mineral nutrients related to EC such as K, Ca, Na, Cl, and $SO_4$ in raw sewage water in greenhouse. We assessed nutrient phytoremediation potential of alien hydrophyte and hydro-crop as well as native landscape hydrophyte to select suitable aquatic plant applied to artificial wetland and buffering site of stream-side. The amount of irrigation water during whole growing period of aquatic plane ranged from 225 L $m^{-2}$ to 444 L $m^{-2}$. indutum which had high biomass consumed the large amount of irrigation water over 350 L $m^{-2}$. As a result of analysis of water purification effect N and P content of shoot biomass, and media soil after experiment, Oryza sativa, Zizania latifolia, Aster subulatus, Coix lachryma-jobi var. indutum showed high purification ability about eutrophication elements such as T-N and T-P. It is presented that Pistia stratiotes, Eichhornia crassipes, and Paspalum distichum var. indutum had excellent purification ability about K, Ca, Na, and Cl. indutum greatly removed $SO_4$ in row sewage water.
