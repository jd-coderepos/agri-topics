Paper Title: Testing of bio-organic fertilizer based on organic waste to improve the productivity of vineyards
Paper Abstract: The authors developed an environmentally safe technology for obtaining liquid organic fertilizer. The technology includes obtaining compost by applying microflora containing actinomycetes and microscopic fungi, populating the compost with vermiculture Eisenia foetida and obtaining biohumus. In 2018-2020 fertilizers obtained from organic waste were used on industrial plantings of technical variety Bastardo Magarachsky (planting scheme: 3 ? 1.5 m, formation - double-shouldered cordon, rootstock - Kober 5 BB, non-irrigated culture) as foliar dressing. Climatic zone and place of experiment: South Coast agroclimatic area, sub-area - with subtropical winter (annual rainfall - 450-500 mm; hydrothermal coefficient of moisture - 0.5-0.6). Standard methods of agronomic observations of growth and development of grape plants were used in the work. Consumption rate 2 l/100 liters of water. The number of treatments - six, the terms of application: shoots growth; before flowering; after flowering; berry growth; beginning of softening; beginning of sugar accumulation (a month before harvesting). It was found that at the background of the same potential productivity of grape plants compared to the control, the yield increased by 15,9%; mass fraction of sugars in berry juice - by 7,1%, mash output - by 14,7%; technological stock of coloring and phenolic substances - by 7,6%.
