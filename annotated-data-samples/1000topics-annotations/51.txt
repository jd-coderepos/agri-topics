Paper Title: From learning to fragile governance: Regional economic development in rural Peru
Paper Abstract: This article analyzes the potential of learning processes to promote governance and economic development in rural areas. It examines how three types of learning in the Lurn River Basin in Peru -technical expertise, storytelling, and experiential knowledge Ð combine to empower rural communities to act collectively. Based on an analysis of three community-led economic development processes -irrigation improvements, tourism and food processing -we show that learning can result in new, albeit fragile, forms of governance and social capital. Fragile governance can turn into regional economic development when learning results in the development of a regional narrative and coordination occurs across both vertical and horizontal network dimensions.
