Paper Title: In vitro Evaluation and Sensitivity of Antibiotics and Fungicides against Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae
Paper Abstract: Cultivation of high yielding varieties of pomegranate with intensive care and management in the recent past under irrigated condition with early stage exploitation of plants has lead to certain severe pest and disease problems. Bacterial blight disease of pomegranate caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae is one of the most destructive disease of pomegranate (Punica granatum) inflicting considerable quantitative and qualitative losses. Mostly the disease occurred on leaves, stems and fruits. Extensive agricultural practices along with large amount of pesticide as well as antibiotic are required to control this disease. The antibiotic sensitivity against eight isolates was studied by paper disk inhibition method. Streptomycine sulphate (250ppm) + COC (2500ppm) was significantly superior than all the treatments showing maximum inhibition zone in all eight isolates of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv
