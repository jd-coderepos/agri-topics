Paper Title: Desempenho agronmico do feijoeiro comum de terceira safra sob irrigao na regio Noroeste do Paran
Paper Abstract: This research was done to evaluate the yield and yield components of bean third crop under irrigation depths in the northwestern region of Paran State. The experiment was conducted in Arenito Campus of the State University of Maringa, Cidade Gacha city. The research was implanted with six irrigation depths (0, 104.1, 171.8, 192.4, 222.9 and 333 mm) and four replicates with a randomized block design and plot banded. The plants number per meter (NPM), pods per plant number (NVP), grains per pod number (NGV), hundred grains weight (MCG), crop height (AP) and height of first pod (AIPV) were evaluated. The yield (PROD), pods per plant number (NVP), grains per pod number (NGV) and hundred grains weight (MCG) responded signicantly to irrigation depths. The highest yield, 2224 kg ha-1 was obtained with application of greater depth, equal to 333 mm.
