Paper Title: Greenhouse Whitefly Control on Marigolds, Michigan, 1991
Paper Abstract: Marigold plants were raised from seed in 6" clay pots for ten wk (10-12" tall) in a research greenhouse infested with whitefly at Michigan State University. The plants were watered by a drip irrigation system for 2 min/d, 4 d/wk (Sun, Mon, Wed, and Fri). Each treatment was replicated 6 times, except the control which was replicated 5 times. Precounts of 6 leaves per plant were completed on 3 May. The leaves were sampled randomly from each plant (3 leaves from the top half and 3 leaves from the bottom half of the plant). Whitefly larvae and pupae on the undersides of leaves were counted within a 38 mm2 area on each of 24 leaflets per plant. Therefore, an area of 30 cm2 per plant was observed. Insecticides were applied with an R D CO2 sprayer with a single 8003 nozzle at 50 psi until runoff. Applications were applied 3 May, 10 May, and 17 May. Postcounts were made in the same manner as precounts on 24 May except whitefly pupae parasitized by Encarsia formosa were also counted. The no. of whiteflies reported for all sample dates is the total no. of whitefly larvae and pupae counted on leaf samples.
