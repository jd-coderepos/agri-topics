Paper Title: Aspectos agronÂ™micos da mamoneira irrigada com efluentes tratados
Paper Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of the castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) irrigated with two types of treated effluents.The statistical design was a randomized block design in 4 treatments and 6 replications: T1: irrigation with water in soil without fertilizer; T2-irrigation with water in soil with fertilizer; T3-irrigation with pond effluent in soil without fertilizer and T4 irrigation with post-treated pond effluent in soil without fertilizer.Among the treatments, the effect of the water types under the growth of the castor bean was evaluated by means of the following variables: Height Caulinar (AC) in cm; Diameter Caulinar (DC) in mm, number of leaves (NF) and shoot dry matter.T3 had higher mean values 43.1 cm; 24.1 mm and 16.7 units for AC, DC and NF, respectively, followed by T4 with 38.3 cm for AC; 23 mm for DC and 14.3 for NF, showing that the nutrients present in the irrigation waters of T3 and T4 must have had a significant influence.For dry matter, T3 was also the best performance treatment, concluding that treated effluents can be reused in castor bean cultivation with good performance.
