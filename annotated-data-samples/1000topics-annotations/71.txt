Paper Title: Use of Liquid Foam to Prevent Freeze Injury tO Strawberry Blossoms
Paper Abstract: Freezing air temperatures occurring during strawberry blossom time frequently result in complete or partial crop failure. In Indiana there is nearly a 50% probability that such temperatures will occur during the strawberry bloom period. The current practices of using a straw mulch or sprinkler irrigation to prevent blossom freezing are limited by unavailability of material or labor, excessive expense, and frequent failure to provide adequate crop protection.
