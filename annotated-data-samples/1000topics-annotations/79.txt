Paper Title: EFFECT OF SPRINKLER IRRIGATION AND COOLING ON YIELD AND QUALITY OF SNAP BEANS
Paper Abstract: High temperatures and dry soil conditions that frequently occur in southern Alberta during July and August may cause objectionably high fiber content of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). During the period 1968√ê71, the response of bean yield and quality to cooling by low-volume sprinkler irrigation during hot weather at the time of pod development was studied. Low-volume sprinkling for cooling prevented undesirable fiber formation and alleviated, to some extent, soil moisture stress. Where soil moisture was returned to field capacity by irrigation at 7- to 10-day intervals, yield and quality also remained high without low-volume sprinkler cooling. Thus, under Alberta conditions, excess fiber formation appears to be closely related to the amount of available soil moisture and can be avoided by proper irrigation with conventional methods.
