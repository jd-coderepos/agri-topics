Paper Title: Furrow Treatments of Systemic Insecticides for Control of <u>M</u>. Persicae and <u>L</u>. <u>Decemlineata</u>, 1976
Paper Abstract: ÔRusset BurbankÕ potatoes were planted in open furrows on April 16, 1976, in Ritzville silt loam soil at Yakima, Washington. After the granular formulated insecticides (listed in table) had been dribbled over the potato seed pieces with a hand-operated, funnel-type applicator, the seed pieces were covered with soil. The plots were 2 rows wide, 34 inches apart (86 cm) and 50 ft long (15.2 m). Each treatment was replicated 3 times in a randomized complete block design. The crop was sprinkler irrigated. Aphids on 20 compound potato leaves per plot were counted June 8 (only 1 aphid found), 17, July 7, and August 4, and Colorado potato beedle damage per plot was rated (from 1 to 10) on August 11, 19, 26, and September 2 (plants were too mature and too badly damaged latter 2 dates to provide meaningful data). The data were subjected to analysis of variance with DuncanÕs Multiple Range Test. A similar experiment was made at Yakima airport in Ahtanum silt loam soil.
