Paper Title: Timothy cultivars in a New Zealand high country environment
Paper Abstract: Herbage yields of 12 timothy cultivars and 4 control grasses were compared over 4 years under 50 250 and 500 (with irrigation) kg N/ha/year in the South Island high country near Lake Tekapo. Timolhy produced high yields (10.9-12.2 t/ha/year) of quality herbagc under high nitrogen and irrigation. Mean yields at 50 and 250 kg N/ha/year were 4.8 and 7.1 t/ha/year respectively under dryland conditions. Differences between the timothy cultivars were small but Grasslands Kahu was the top- or near the top-performing of the 12 cultivars tested at all times. Keywords: cultivars, high country, Phleum pratense
