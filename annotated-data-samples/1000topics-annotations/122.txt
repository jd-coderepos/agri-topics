Paper Title: Effect of Moisture Depletion on Gynoecious Cucumber Genotypes and Water Consumption Estimation
Paper Abstract: The study was carried out in the College of Agriculture, University of Anbar, in the fall agricultural season for the year 2022. A factorial experiment of two factors was designed according to the arrangement of the split plots according to the randomized complete block design with three replicate, The first factor included two levels of moisture depletion, 25 and 50% of the water available to the plant, calculated according to the weight method, and placed in the main plots, and the second factor included 5 genotypes With a sixth hybrid to compare (Kanz), placed in the sub plots, Drip irrigation was used in the irrigation of the experiment using GR tubes with a drainage of 3.2 liters h ?1 . The results of the study showed that moisture depletion exceeded 25% in the characteristics of plant height, number of nodes, number of fruits, and plant yield, as it reached 288.04 cm and 31.07 nodes Plant ?1 42.23 fruits Plant ?1 3.68 kg Plant ?1 , respectively, while moisture depletion recorded 50% 252.59 cm. And 26.98 nodes Plant ?1 37.69 fruit plant ?1 3.15 kg plant ?1 , respectively, for the same characteristics. While the depletion exceeded 50% in the early yield, reaching 1.313 kg plant ?1 . We conclude from the experiment that the best genotypes were the 4?1 hybrid and irrigation at the level of 25% depletion was the best in all traits except early in yield.
