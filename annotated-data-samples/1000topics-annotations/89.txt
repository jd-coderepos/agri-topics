Paper Title: Fall Control of Oriental Beetle Grubs with Insecticides and Entomogenous Nematodes on a Golf Course J 1987
Paper Abstract: Four insecticides and 1 species of entomogenous nematode were applied to a rough at Lido Beach Country Club, Long Island, N.Y., on 12 Aug fori control of Oriental beetle grubs. The rough consisted of annual bluegrass (75%) and broadleaf weeds (25%). The experimental design was a randomized! complete block with 4 replications. Individual plots were 10 ? 10 ft. Granular materials were applied with a precalibrated Gandy 2.5 spreader. Liquid,- materials were premeasured in the laboratory and applied in 2 directions within each plot with 11.4 liters (3 gal) of water through a watering can. At treatment time-(12 Aug) the following environmental conditions existed: air temperature, 81¡F; soil temperature, 86¡F (1 inch), 82¡F (3 inches); soil pH 6.1; water pH 5.84; soil moisture, 21.4%; soil texture, 7.9% coarse sand, 45.5% medium sand, 36.4% fine sand, 5.9% very fine sand, and 4.3% silt and clay; thatch, 0.25 inches. Following treatment, the plots recieved 0.5 inches of irrigation by sprinkler. The nematodes, Heterorhabditis sp. (strain HP 88), were applied on 20 Aug at a rate of 5 billion/acre in 5 liters of water through a sprinkling can to the center 4 sq ft of each plot. The nematode application site was immediately watered in by hand with additional water for a total of 11.4 liters. At this time the following environmental conditions existed: air temperature, 84¡F; soil temp, 79¡F (1 inch). Posttreatment counts were taken on 22 Sep by cutting a 1- ? 3-ft strip lengthwise through the middle of each plot by hand and examining the sod and underlying soil for grubs. A 3-sq-ft sample of sod was examined in each plot, and the surviving grubs were counted. Grub species identifications were made in the field. At this time oriental beetle grubs were 80% third instars and 20% second instars.
