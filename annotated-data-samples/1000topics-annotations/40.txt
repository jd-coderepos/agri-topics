Paper Title: Efficacy of Insecticides for Control of Japanese Beetle Grubs in Kentucky, 1983
Paper Abstract: The main study (Test 1) was conducted in an irrigated Kentucky bluegrass fairway in Lexington, Ky. The initial infestation level was about eight third-stage beetle grubs per ft . Thatch accumulation was negligible and temperature at the time of treatment (9 a.m., 31 Aug.) was 85Â¡C, with sunny skies and almost no wind. The experimental design was a RCB with four replications. Individual plots were 6 by 9 ft with a 1-ft boundary between all plots. Granular materials were mixed with sand and hand shaken over the plots. Liquid formulations were mixed with water at the proper rates and applied with a low volume CO2 sprayer equipped with four Spraying System 730308 Tee Jet nozzles operated at 30 lb/in2. After all treatments were applied, the entire site was irrigated with about 1.5 in. of water using the golf course sprinkler system. The pH of the water used for mixing sprays and for irrigation was 6.2. Surviving grubs were sampled after 9 and 28 days by cutting a 1 by 7-ft strip lengthwise through each plot with a mechanical sod cutter, and examining the sod and underlying soil for grubs. Because the variances were proportional to the squares of the treatment means, a logarithmic transformation was used before ANOVA. The actual means for the grub counts are reported in the table. To confirm the relative effectiveness of Diazinon vs. Mocap, a second test (Test 2) was conducted in another, heavily infested fairway (ca. Plots were 9 by 9 ft and were treated on 12 Sep. Methods of application, irrigation, sampling and data analysis were as described above. The plots were sampled 15 days after treatment (DAT).
