Paper Title: THE PROCESS OF SOLONETZIZATION OF SOILS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MINERALIZED WATERS
Paper Abstract: In the soils studied by us, changes in the composition of the soil absorption complex (SAC) occur mainly between three cations, such as Ca++, Mg++, Na+, the radii of which differ from each other within 20%. According to A.E., Fersman [11], when the ion radii differ by up to 20%, cations are considered interchangeable, in other words, isomorphic in the crystal lattices of minerals, which is why when irrigating with mineralized water, sodium ions replace Mg++ and Ca++ ions. This substitution occurs gradually and over a long period the influence of mineralized waters and at a certain stage quantitatively stabilizes. In order to predict the probability of the sodium cation entering the SAC, and therefore the potential danger of soil alkalinization during irrigation with mineralized waters, a special indicator SAR (Sodium adsorption ratio) is used, which, based on Ca ++, Mg ++, Na data, makes it possible to assess the quality of irrigation water. Our waters, both river and mineralized, had a low risk of salinization and alkalinization according to this indicator, and therefore, when they were used as irrigation water, they did not render the soil unusable for a short period of 3-10 years, i.e. in terms of solonetzization, there were no significant changes, the soils were not solonetzic and remained so. But the process of solonetzization took place.
