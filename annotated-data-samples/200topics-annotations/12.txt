Paper Title: By budgeting irrigated pasture growth rates, managers control forage levels and animal performance
Paper Abstract: Traditionally, little control is exerted over grazing on irrigated pasture. Today, however, with controlled grazing and feed budgeting, the pasture manager can use grazing stock to control forage levels, and forage levels can be used to control animal performance. Pasture budgeting can be applied to California's irrigated pastures when estimates of expected pasture growth are available, according to an ongoing study.

Justification:

The OA topic "Nutritional Strategies for Ruminant Health and Production" is complementary because the paper addresses the management of forage levels and animal performance, which are key components of nutritional strategies for ruminants.

The OG topic "Forage Quality and Dairy Grazing" is also complementary because the study involves budgeting irrigated pasture growth to control forage levels, which directly impacts forage quality and grazing management. Both topics highlight relevant aspects of the paper, making them equally applicable.
