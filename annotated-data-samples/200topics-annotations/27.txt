Paper Title: Risk factors with the occurrence of parasites and coliform in vegetables from an agroindustry
Paper Abstract: In this study, we evaluated the risk factors associated with the occurrence of total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and intestinal parasite eggs in vegetables from an agroindustry in the city of Ibina - SP, Brazil. A questionnaire with 17 questions was applied to 24 producers to carry out a diagnosis of the risk factors and their posterior association or not with total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and intestinal parasite eggs. The questions addressed mainly the production system, fertilizer used, source of the water used for irrigation, sanitization of the vegetables, and form of transport. For the investigation of total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms, and intestinal parasite eggs, the samples were processed at the microbiology and parasitology laboratory of the Federal Institute of So Paulo, So Roque Campus. The results revealed that total coliforms were found in 100% of the investigated samples and thermotolerant coliforms were detected in 95.83% of the samples. There was a significant statistical association for the risk factor use of reservoir water, where there was release of wastewater and absence of sanitization of the vegetables at the moment of harvest in relation to the presence of thermotolerant coliforms. Intestinal parasite eggs were found in 33.33% of the samples.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: yes

which_is_better: n/a

comment_OA: complementary

comment_OG: complementary

Justification:

The OA topic "Food Safety and Hygiene Practices" is complementary because the study evaluates the risk factors related to the presence of coliforms and parasitic eggs in vegetables, which is directly related to food safety and hygiene practices.

The OG topic "Foodborne Pathogens in Vegetables" is also complementary because it addresses the presence of pathogens like coliforms and intestinal parasites in vegetables, which aligns well with the study's focus. Both topics capture important aspects of the study and are equally applicable.
