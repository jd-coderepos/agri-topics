Paper Title: Role of Homegarden Agroforestry Practice in Climate Change Adaptation in Aleta Chuko Woreda, Sidama Region, Southern Ethiopia
Paper Abstract: Indeed, the adverse effects of climate change are already evident in resource poor countries including Ethiopia.Southern Ethiopia is known with favorable environment for homegarden agroforestry (HGAF) Production practices.This study aimed at examining the role of HGAF practice in climate change adaptation in Aleta Chuko woreda, Southern Ethiopia.Multistage sampling procedures have used to select sample households.Data were collected from adopter and non-adopter categories of HGAF practice with similar socioeconomic background.A total of 141 households (68 adopters and 73 nonadopter) were involved in the household survey.The result revealed about 95% of the respondents observed the change in rainfall in the past three decades, whether decrease, late-onset or early cessation.While 87.3% of respondents perceived an increase in temperature.Farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change in the area context were soil and water conservation, application of inorganic fertilizer, use of small-scale irrigation and improved crop type were the tactical responses to climate change adaptation in the two adoption categories.It revealed that adoption of HGAF practice exhibit significance difference in terms of adaptation of climate change and sustaining of food security among the two adoption categories.From the result of analysis, access to credit and extension service, educational status, family size and membership of cooperative group shows statistically significant association in adoption of HGAF practices.The study concludes that policies that prioritize interventions to maximize the opportunities for climate change adaptation through HGAF system should been established in the context of the area.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Urban Agriculture and Community Development" is wrong because the paper does not focus on urban agriculture. Instead, it examines the role of homegarden agroforestry practices in climate change adaptation in a rural area of Southern Ethiopia.

The OG topic "Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture" is precise because it directly addresses the primary focus of the paper, which is the role of homegarden agroforestry practices in helping farmers adapt to climate change. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content and objectives of the paper.
