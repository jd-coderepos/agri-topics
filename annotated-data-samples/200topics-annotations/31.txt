Paper Title: ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF LOWLAND RICE DURING THE SECOND PLANTING SEASON IN PALEMBANG CITY, INDONESIA
Paper Abstract: Swamp rice cultivation during the second planting season (October-March), known as IP 200, which is directed in 4 sub-districts in Palembang is expected to contribute to rice production for the city of Palembang and to support national food security program.Out of 4 sub-districts, 3 sub-districts were chosen to be the locations of this survey.Respondents of this survey were members of the farmer groups who were selected randomly using proportionate random sampling.The results showed that lowland rice production in the second planting season was influenced significantly by farmers' technical ability in cultivation (X 1 ), production facilities and infrastructure (X 2 ) and irrigation networks (X 3 ).

match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OA

comment_OA: precise

comment_OG: wrong

Justification:

The OA topic "Sustainability of Agricultural Practices in Developing Countries" is precise because the paper discusses factors influencing the productivity of lowland rice in Palembang, Indonesia, during the second planting season, touching on aspects like technical ability, infrastructure, and irrigation, which are essential to sustainable agricultural practices in a developing country context.

The OG topic "Global Rice Farming Challenges" is wrong because it implies a broader focus on global issues, whereas the paper specifically examines localized factors affecting rice productivity in Palembang, Indonesia. Therefore, the OA topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.
