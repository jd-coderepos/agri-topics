Paper Title: Performance of High Tunnel Tomato Cultivars in Northern New England
Paper Abstract: Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) growers select cultivars based on a range of performance criteria. Currently, however, information regarding tomato cultivar performance in high tunnels is lacking. We conducted a tomato cultivar trial in an 1800-ft 2 plastic-covered high tunnel in Durham, NH, with 15 indeterminate cultivars using organic fertilizers and pesticides. Tomatoes were grown in-ground in a randomized complete block design (n = 4) using raised beds with plastic mulch and drip irrigation. Marketable and unmarketable yield, several yield components, and susceptibility to two common diseases, leaf mold ( Fulvia fulva ) and powdery mildew ( Oidium lycopersici or Leveillula taurica ), were evaluated over a 3-year period. Differences between cultivars existed in all areas of interest, and year-to-year variation in performance was noteworthy in this experiment. ÔGeronimoÕ consistently had among the highest yields, ÔArbasonÕ and ÔMassadaÕ produced many individual fruit, and several cultivars including Rebelski, Massada, and Geronimo showed no signs of disease. Some cultivars such as Conestoga appeared susceptible to several different physiological disorders while others were relatively robust against this type of marketable yield reduction. Because we assessed multiple yield and quality variables and observed apparent trade-offs in several of these, we used radar plots to summarize and communicate the performance of each cultivar in an intuitive and comparable manner. Based on these data, several tomato cultivars appear particularly well suited for high tunnel production in northern New England.

Justification:

The OA topic "Study of Powdery Mildew Fungi and Plant Pathogens" is complementary because the study does address susceptibility to plant pathogens like leaf mold and powdery mildew among different tomato cultivars. However, it does not capture the broader focus on multiple performance criteria of tomato cultivars in high tunnel production.

The OG topic "Tomato Irrigation & Cultivation Techniques" is precise because it directly addresses the primary focus of the paper, which involves evaluating various tomato cultivars for high tunnel production, including aspects of irrigation, disease resistance, and overall performance. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the specific goals and content of the paper.
