OA_Topic: Sustainable Management of Rangelands and Livestock
OG_Topic: Small-Scale Irrigation Impact 

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Sustainable Management of Rangelands and Livestock" is wrong because the paper specifically focuses on the factors affecting smallholder farmers' participation in small-scale irrigation systems in the Deder District of Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. It does not address the broader topic of rangeland and livestock management.

The OG topic "Small-Scale Irrigation Impact" is precise because it accurately reflects the main focus of the paper, which is on understanding the factors influencing farmer participation in small-scale irrigation and the levels of their participation. Therefore, the OG topic more appropriately matches the content of the paper.
