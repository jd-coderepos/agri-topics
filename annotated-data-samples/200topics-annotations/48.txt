Paper Title: INFLUENCE OF LOCATION ON NUTRIENTS COMPOSITION OF CAMEL BROWSE VEGETATIONS
Paper Abstract: The camel is a typical animal whose preference for browsing depends on the forage species, amount and nutritional quality of the plant.We hypothesize that the quality and availability of forages for camel feeding is influenced by multiple environmental and anthropogenic factors including the composition and structure of grazing land.Current study was therefore themed to assess the locational influence on major nutrients among camel browse vegetations at desert, irrigated and coastal zones of Sindh province.Study was conducted into two phases.Phase one was included to monitor and collect the samples of camel browse vegetations from all three zones of Sindh province, while in second phase samples were analyzed at the Laboratory for the major nutrients.Obtained data was analyzed by statistical procedure i.e. randomized complete block design under factorial models for observing the significant variations among the variables within districts as well as between vegetations.Results indicated desert area (Mithi) possessing negative effect on moisture and positive on the dry matter.Organic matter of Salvadora oleiodes (79.80%) was more favored at irrigated area (Tando Allahyar), while inorganic matter (40.60%) was supported at desert (Mithi).Prominent effect was also observed on ether extract of Prosopis juliflora at Tando Allahyar and Acacia nilotica at Mithi at irrigated area though pertained significantly higher values.Nitrogen free extract and total carbohydrate of Salvadora oleiodes at desert and coastal area was recorded significantly low compared to irrigated.Crude fiber in Salvadora oleiodes (23.80%) was more favored at coastal area, but not at the desert.Study concludes that the location significantly influences the nutrients composition of camel browse vegetations.Desert area negatively affect the moisture content and positively the dry matter, inorganic matter and ether extract contents.The organic matter and crude protein contents are more favored at irrigated area, while coastal area support the concentration of crude fiber.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: complementary

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Compositional and Nutritional Aspects of Camel Milk" is wrong because the paper does not discuss camel milk. Instead, it focuses on the nutrient composition of vegetation browsed by camels in different locations.

The OG topic "Forage Quality and Dairy Grazing" is precise because it directly addresses the main focus of the paper, which is the quality and nutrient composition of forage available to camels in desert, irrigated, and coastal zones. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.

Overall, the OG topic is complementary to the study's emphasis on forage quality and its impacts on camel nutrition.
