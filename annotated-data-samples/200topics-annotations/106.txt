Paper Title: Bacterial community composition of bulk soil from date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) farm depend on irrigation water salinity
Paper Abstract: Non-saline and saline ground water irrigation is extensively used in the arid regions of United Arab Emirates (UAE) for date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) cultivation without knowing its effect on bulk soil bacterial communities. Bulk soil acts as a supply base for microbes and nutrients that are accessed by date palm roots. We collected soil samples from date farms across UAE and performed V3-V4 16s rRNA metabarcoding analysis to understand how bulk soil bacterial diversity and communities respond to irrigation water sources (non-saline and saline groundwater irrigation). There was no significant variation in bulk bacterial diversity (Shannon diversity, richness as well as evenness). But bulk bacterial communities differed between irrigation water sources and irrigation water electrical conductivity was the significant factor that explained a part of community variation. Out of total 5089 OTUs, saline bulk soil harbored only 21.3% of total OTUs compared to 31.5% OTUs in non-saline bulk soil, while 47.15% OTUs shared between both types of irrigation. Proteobacteria abundance was higher in saline bulk soil, while Actinobacteriota abundance was enhanced in non-saline bulk soil. Similar selection was observed at genus level, wherein saline bulk soil showed increase in abundance of Subgroup_10, Nitrospira and Mycobacterium, whereas Microvirga, Ammoniphilus, Nitrospira and Lysinibacillus were elevated in non-saline bulk soil. Saline (Novibacillus and Bauldea) and non-saline bulk soil (Microvirga, Marmoricola, Domibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Bhargavaea and Solirubrobacter) showed significant selection of indicator taxa (P 0.05). This indicate that bacterial communities colonizing bulk soil differ depending on irrigation water source and it is affected by irrigation water EC.

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) Research" is complementary because the study involves date palm farms and investigates factors affecting their cultivation. However, it does not fully capture the specific focus on soil bacterial communities and their response to irrigation water salinity.

The OG topic "Soil Microbial Dynamics" is precise because it directly addresses the primary focus of the paper, which is the analysis of soil bacterial community composition and how it is influenced by the salinity of irrigation water. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the specific content and objectives of the paper.
