Paper Title: Use of Liquid Foam to Prevent Freeze Injury tO Strawberry Blossoms
Paper Abstract: Freezing air temperatures occurring during strawberry blossom time frequently result in complete or partial crop failure. In Indiana there is nearly a 50% probability that such temperatures will occur during the strawberry bloom period. The current practices of using a straw mulch or sprinkler irrigation to prevent blossom freezing are limited by unavailability of material or labor, excessive expense, and frequent failure to provide adequate crop protection.

Justification:

The OA topic "Genetic and Environmental Factors in Berry Production" is specific but not aligned with the primary focus of the paper. While environmental factors are involved, the study specifically addresses the use of liquid foam to prevent freeze injury in strawberry blossoms rather than a broader discussion on genetic and environmental factors in berry production.

The OG topic "Strawberry Cultivation & Quality" is precise because it directly addresses the core theme of the paper, which involves strategies to improve the cultivation and quality of strawberries by preventing freeze injury during the blossom period. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content and objectives of the paper.
