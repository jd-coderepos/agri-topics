Paper Title: Effects of Irrigation and Planting Geometry on Soybean (Glycine max L.) Seed Nutrition in Humid Climates
Paper Abstract: This study investigates the effect of irrigation (FI, all rows-irrigation; HI, alternate row irrigation; RF, rainfed) and planting geometry (PG) (SR, single-row; TR, twin-row) on soybean seed constituents. Results showed that most of these seed components were significantly affected by crop season due to contrasting precipitation and solar radiation patterns, particularly during July-August, coinciding with early reproductive and seed development stages. Both seed protein and oil levels responded positively to irrigation, while most of the amino acids were nonresponsive. The protein content ranged between 36.3 and 37.6% in 2018, while it was between 36.4 and 38.3% in 2019. Among amino acids, glycine, alanine, valine, and methionine levels were significantly higher in both FI and HI treatments. Among sugars, only sucrose was higher in response to the RF treatment, and irrigation did not affect both stachyose and raffinose. Oleic acid was higher in RF, while no significant differences were observed for linolenic and linoleic acids. Similarly, seasonal variation was significant for stearic acid content, but the 2019 season had relatively higher accumulation (stearic acid: between 4.1 and 4.5% in 2018 and from 4.6 to 4.9% in 2019). These results indicate that both irrigation and climate during seed development can alter some seed composition constituents and play critical roles in determining seed nutritional qualities.

Justification:

The OA topic "Genetic Diversity and Improvement of Soybean" is specific but does not align well with the core focus of the paper. While the study relates to soybean seed quality, it specifically investigates the effects of irrigation and planting geometry on nutrient composition under different climatic conditions, rather than genetic diversity or improvement.

The OG topic "Soybean Water Stress Management" is precise because it directly captures the primary focus of the paper, which is exploring how different irrigation methods and planting geometries affect soybean seed nutritional quality in humid climates. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content and primary objectives of the paper.
