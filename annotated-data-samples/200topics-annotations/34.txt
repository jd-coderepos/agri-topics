Paper Title: Cucumber cultivation technology using tunnel covers
Paper Abstract: Obtaining early cucumber production in the Volgograd region sharp-continental climate with frequent early spring frosts is possible only with using tunnel covers. A distinctive feature of the considered technology is cucumber cultivation using tunnel covers with insulated zone organization by making cracks in the soil with filling them with straw. This provides the comfortable conditions creation for the plants preservation when there is a sharp drop in air and soil temperature in spring and a possible return of spring frosts. Maintaining soil moisture in the 0,5 m layer at the level of 90% of the lowest moisture capacity by drip irrigation allowed to obtain a cucumber yield at the level of 85,9 t/ha, which is 7,8 t/ha more than in the basic option.

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Adaptation of Forage Production to Climate Change" is wrong because the paper does not focus on forage production or its adaptation to climate change. Instead, it discusses the technology of cucumber cultivation using tunnel covers and managing soil moisture through drip irrigation to enhance yield.

The OG topic "Cucumber Fertigation and Irrigation Studies" is precise because it directly addresses the main themes of the paper, which are the use of tunnel covers and drip irrigation to improve cucumber cultivation and yield in a climate with spring frosts. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.
