Paper Title: THE PLAN OF ACTION OF THE AGRICULTURE AND IRRIGATION SECTOR AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE: AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARTICULATE EFFORTS
Paper Abstract: The participation of the Peruvian greenhouse gasses emissions in the agriculture sector in the total emissions grew from 13% in 2005 to 15% in 2010 and 2012 (MINAM, 2016). However, do the global increase in Peruvian GHG emissions and the raising participation of the agriculture and livestock sector from 2005 to 2012 result from a lack of action around climate change? There are more than 25 strategies, plans and programs that exhibit actions about mitigation, adaptation and disasters risk management on the agriculture and irrigation sector. This investigation aims to demonstrate that these policies were made with a soft integration among them. For these matters, a density, weight and intermediation analysis through Gephiﾃ不 software, which constructs nets based on the proposed measures on all those documents for adaptation, mitigation and disasters risk management, will be made. Preliminary results show that the most articulated document for adaptation is the National Strategy against Climate Change, for mitigation the iNDC, the coffeeﾃ不 and oil palmﾃ不 NAMAs and the Plan of Action for Adaptation and Mitigation against Climate Change, for disasters risk management the Budget Program 068, and in general the Ministry of Agricultureﾃ不 Multiannual Sectorial Strategic Plan. Keywords: Agriculture, irrigation, climate change, articulation, mitigation, adaptation, disasters risk management

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: complementary

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Food and Agriculture in Latin America" is complementary because the paper discusses policies and strategies related to agriculture and irrigation in Peru, which is part of Latin America. However, it does not directly focus on food and agriculture broadly across the region.

The OG topic "Climate Change Adaptation in Agriculture" is precise because it directly addresses the primary focus of the paper, which is the evaluation of various strategies and plans related to climate change adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk management in the agriculture and irrigation sector in Peru. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content and specific focus of the paper.
