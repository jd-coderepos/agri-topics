Paper Title: Desempenho agronmico do feijoeiro comum de terceira safra sob irrigao na regio Noroeste do Paran
Paper Abstract: This research was done to evaluate the yield and yield components of bean third crop under irrigation depths in the northwestern region of Paran State. The experiment was conducted in Arenito Campus of the State University of Maringa, Cidade Gacha city. The research was implanted with six irrigation depths (0, 104.1, 171.8, 192.4, 222.9 and 333 mm) and four replicates with a randomized block design and plot banded. The plants number per meter (NPM), pods per plant number (NVP), grains per pod number (NGV), hundred grains weight (MCG), crop height (AP) and height of first pod (AIPV) were evaluated. The yield (PROD), pods per plant number (NVP), grains per pod number (NGV) and hundred grains weight (MCG) responded signicantly to irrigation depths. The highest yield, 2224 kg ha-1 was obtained with application of greater depth, equal to 333 mm.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Effects of Soil Compaction on Crop Production" is wrong because the paper focuses on evaluating the yield and yield components of a third crop of common beans under different irrigation depths, rather than on soil compaction and its impact on crop production.

The OG topic "Bean Cultivation & Water Efficiency" is precise because it directly addresses the main focus of the paper, which is the effect of various irrigation depths on the cultivation and water use efficiency of common beans in the northwestern region of Paraná State. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content and objectives of the paper.
