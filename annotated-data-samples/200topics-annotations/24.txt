Justification:

The OA topic "Agricultural Development and Policy in South Asia" is complementary because the study examines the agricultural development and identifies key agricultural indicators in Haryana, which is a part of South Asia. It aligns well with the regional focus on agricultural development and policy.

The OG topic "Indian Agriculture and Economy" is also complementary as it broadly encompasses the socio-economic and agricultural development aspects of Haryana, a state in India. Both topics capture important aspects of the study and are equally applicable.
