Paper Title: Aspectos agronÂ™micos da mamoneira irrigada com efluentes tratados
Paper Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of the castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) irrigated with two types of treated effluents.The statistical design was a randomized block design in 4 treatments and 6 replications: T1: irrigation with water in soil without fertilizer; T2-irrigation with water in soil with fertilizer; T3-irrigation with pond effluent in soil without fertilizer and T4 irrigation with post-treated pond effluent in soil without fertilizer.Among the treatments, the effect of the water types under the growth of the castor bean was evaluated by means of the following variables: Height Caulinar (AC) in cm; Diameter Caulinar (DC) in mm, number of leaves (NF) and shoot dry matter.T3 had higher mean values 43.1 cm; 24.1 mm and 16.7 units for AC, DC and NF, respectively, followed by T4 with 38.3 cm for AC; 23 mm for DC and 14.3 for NF, showing that the nutrients present in the irrigation waters of T3 and T4 must have had a significant influence.For dry matter, T3 was also the best performance treatment, concluding that treated effluents can be reused in castor bean cultivation with good performance.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Utilization of Forest Biomass for Various Applications" is wrong because the paper does not discuss the utilization of forest biomass. Instead, it focuses on the effects of different types of treated effluents on the growth of castor bean plants.

The OG topic "Bean Cultivation & Water Efficiency" is precise because it accurately reflects the main focus of the paper, which is the cultivation of castor beans (Ricinus communis L.) and the impact of using treated effluents for irrigation on their growth and water efficiency. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.
