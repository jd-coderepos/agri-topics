Paper Title: Avaliação de mudas de maracujazeiro com diferentes tipos de substratos e concentrações salinas
Paper Abstract: The yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Degener) crops have been gaining notoriety in Brazil, whose cultivation extends to almost all regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings in response to the interaction between substrate composition and irrigation water salinity levels. The experimental trial was installed in a randomized block design, with a factorial scheme (3x6) consisting of two factors: three levels of salinity and six types of substrates, distributed in four replications, each plot consisting of a polyethylene bag composed of two plants. The factor levels of salinity, electrical conductivity: 0.3, 1.2 and 2.1 dSm-1 did not influence the physiological growth and development of the seedlings, the substrates resulted in statistically significant effects, the cattle manure presented the highest percentage in levels of physiological growth and development of the plant.

Justification:

OA Topic: Plant Nutrition and Growth Optimization

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it broadly covers plant nutrition and growth optimization in general, while the paper specifically focuses on the salinity levels and substrates influencing passion fruit seedling growth.

OG Topic: Passion Fruit Salinity Studies

    Comment: The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the core content of the paper, which is about the impact of salinity levels and different substrates on the growth of yellow passion fruit seedlings.
