Paper Title: Testing of bio-organic fertilizer based on organic waste to improve the productivity of vineyards
Paper Abstract: The authors developed an environmentally safe technology for obtaining liquid organic fertilizer. The technology includes obtaining compost by applying microflora containing actinomycetes and microscopic fungi, populating the compost with vermiculture Eisenia foetida and obtaining biohumus. In 2018-2020 fertilizers obtained from organic waste were used on industrial plantings of technical variety Bastardo Magarachsky (planting scheme: 3 Ã— 1.5 m, formation - double-shouldered cordon, rootstock - Kober 5 BB, non-irrigated culture) as foliar dressing. Climatic zone and place of experiment: South Coast agroclimatic area, sub-area - with subtropical winter (annual rainfall - 450-500 mm; hydrothermal coefficient of moisture - 0.5-0.6). Standard methods of agronomic observations of growth and development of grape plants were used in the work. Consumption rate 2 l/100 liters of water. The number of treatments - six, the terms of application: shoots growth; before flowering; after flowering; berry growth; beginning of softening; beginning of sugar accumulation (a month before harvesting). It was found that at the background of the same potential productivity of grape plants compared to the control, the yield increased by 15,9%; mass fraction of sugars in berry juice - by 7,1%, mash output - by 14,7%; technological stock of coloring and phenolic substances - by 7,6%.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Agricultural Science and Technology**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is broadly related to the paper because the study deals with the application of agricultural technology, specifically the development and use of bio-organic fertilizers. This makes the topic complementary but not specific to the particular focus of the study.

**OG Topic: Compost Use in Agriculture**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the content of the paper. The study centers on the use of bio-organic fertilizer derived from organic waste in improving the productivity of vineyards. It details the composting process, application methods, and resultant productivity benefits for grape plants.

**Overall Justification:** While the OA topic is broadly connected and thus complementary, the OG topic is more precise and better captures the specific focus of the study on the use of compost and bio-organic fertilizers in agriculture, specifically for vineyard productivity.
