Paper Title: Spatial Variability of the Organic Matter in the Soil in Cassava Cultivation Under Differentiated Management
Paper Abstract: The management of soil organic matter (SOM) is fundamental in agriculture for soil conservation and crop yields. However, in addition the soil being dynamics, it is heterogeneous, therefore, understanding the spatial variability of SOM is essential. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial variability of SOM in a cassava cultivation under different management, seeking to classify its spatial dependence by geostatistics. A filed experiment was conducted out on soil classified as oxisol with four different management systems: irrigation (micro sprinkler, drip and no irrigation), spacing (1.0 0.8 m, 1.0 1.0 m and 1.0 1.5 m), weed control (manual control and no control) and acidity correction (limestone and withouth limestone), totaling 36 experimental plots. To determine the SOM, the wet oxidation method was used, and the semivariograms were generated by the GS+ software. The effect of the different management systems on the spatial variability of the SOM was evaluated at a depth of 0.0-0.2 m. The theoretical semivariogram model that best fitted the study was the Gaussian model, with a well-defined level, also expressing the condition of data stationarity. The spatial dependence was classified as strong and, through the thematic map generated from the kriging, it was possible to observe the variability in the SOM content for different management zones. The use of geostatistics techniques provided important information for understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic matter.

Justification:

The OA topic "Cyanogenic Glycosides in Plants and Industrial Wastewaters" is wrong because the paper does not focus on cyanogenic glycosides but rather on the spatial variability of soil organic matter in cassava cultivation under different management practices.

The OG topic "SOC and Climate Change Mitigation" is also wrong. While the paper deals with soil organic matter (SOM), the focus is on its spatial variability in cassava cultivation rather than its role in climate change mitigation. Neither topic accurately reflects the content and focus of the paper.
