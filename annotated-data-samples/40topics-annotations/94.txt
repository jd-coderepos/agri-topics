Paper Title: Effects of the Irrigation with Treated Wastewaters on the Proximate Composition, Mineral, and Polyphenolic Profile of the Globe Artichoke Heads [Cynara cardunculus (L.)]
Paper Abstract: The present work was carried out to evaluate the effects of irrigation with two different municipal wastewaters (secondary-treated wastewater (SW) and tertiary-treated wastewater (TW)) compared to freshwater (FW) on main qualitative parameters of three different classes of globe artichoke (main, secondary, and processing heads). The experimental trial was conducted in Southern Italy (Apulia region) for two cropping cycles (GS1 and GS2) using Violetto di Provenza as cultivar. The artichoke heads were analyzed for proximate composition (dry matter, total sugar, total fat, ash, and total protein), percentage of edible part, mineral profile (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, copper, iron, nickel, zinc, chloride, nitrate, phosphate, and sulphate) and polyphenolic acids content (caffeoylquinic acids and flavones). Both SW and TW treatments caused an increase of the percentage of the edible part, head protein contents, and mineral elements of the main and processing heads. Moreover, SW statistically increased the caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and the trans-ferulic acid content, while both SW and TW the flavones content. Finally, according to the multivariate analysis adopted, in our experimental conditions, the mineral component of the heads, such as chloride, potassium, copper, and zinc content, had a greater weight in the separation of FW, SW, and TW. On the other hand, the polyphenolic 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and 1,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid had a greater weight in the separation of the head class groups (main, secondary, and processing). Moreover, the trans-ferulic acid content of the heads was related both to the irrigation water type and to the different head classes.

OA Topic: Artichoke Nutraceutical and Functional Food Research

    Comment: The OA topic is complementary as it relates to the nutritional value and potential health benefits of artichokes, which connects to the study's findings on the proximate composition and polyphenolic profile of artichoke heads. However, it is not as focused on the aspect of irrigation with treated wastewater, which is central to the study.

OG Topic: Wastewater Treatment and Reuse

    Comment: The OG topic is precise as it directly addresses the core of the research, which is the impact of using treated wastewater for irrigation on the composition and quality of globe artichoke heads. This topic accurately captures the central theme of the study.

Overall Justification: While the OA topic is broadly related to the study's focus on the nutritional aspects of artichokes, the OG topic more accurately reflects the specific research question about the use of treated wastewater for irrigation and its effects, making it a better fit.
