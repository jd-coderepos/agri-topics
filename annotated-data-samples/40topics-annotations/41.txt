### Justification:

**OA Topic: Sustainable Management of Rangelands and Livestock**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is incorrect because the paper does not focus on rangelands or livestock management. Instead, it examines the factors affecting smallholder farmers' participation in small-scale irrigation in a specific district in Ethiopia.

**OG Topic: Small Scale Irrigation Development**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the focus of the paper. The study is centered on small-scale irrigation development and the factors influencing the participation levels of smallholder farmers in the Deder district of Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia.

**Overall Justification:** The OG topic closely aligns with the specific focus and content of the paper, making it the better choice. The OA topic does not accurately represent the subject matter discussed in the study.
