Paper Title: Cacao Phylloplane: The First Battlefield against <i>Moniliophthora perniciosa</i>, Which Causes Witches Broom Disease
Paper Abstract: The phylloplane is the first contact surface between Theobroma cacao and the fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes witches' broom disease (WBD). We evaluated the index of short glandular trichomes (SGT) in the cacao phylloplane and the effect of irrigation on the disease index of cacao genotypes with or without resistance to WBD, and identified proteins present in the phylloplane. The resistant genotype CCN51 and susceptible Catongo presented a mean index of 1,600 and 700 SGT cm-2, respectively. The disease index in plants under drip irrigation was reduced by approximately 30% compared with plants under sprinkler irrigation prior to inoculation. Leaf water wash (LWW) of the cacao inhibited the germination of spores by up to 98%. Proteins from the LWW of CCN51 were analyzed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The gel showed 71 spots and identified a total of 42 proteins (28 from the plant and 14 from bacteria). Proteins related to defense and synthesis of defense metabolites and involved in nucleic acid metabolism were identified. The results support the hypothesis that the proteins and water-soluble compounds secreted to the cacao phylloplane participate in the defense against pathogens. They also suggest that SGT can contribute to the resistance of cacao.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Cacao Agroforestry Management and Conservation**
- **Comment:** While the OA topic may not precisely capture the paper's specific focus on the cacao phylloplane and resistance mechanisms against witches' broom disease, it does relate to overall cacao management and conservation strategies, which can be complementary to understanding disease resistance mechanisms in the broader context of cacao agroforestry.

**OG Topic: White Mold in Common Beans**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is wrong because the content of the paper is focused on the specific interactions between cacao and Moniliophthora perniciosa and does not relate to white mold in common beans.

**Overall Justification:** The OA topic, while not precise, is broadly connected to the subject matter and thus can be considered complementary. The OG topic, however, is entirely unrelated to the paper's focus. A more accurate topic for this paper would be related to "Resistance Mechanisms in Cacao Against Witches’ Broom Disease" or "Cacao Phylloplane and Disease Resistance."
