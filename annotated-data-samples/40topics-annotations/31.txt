Paper Title: ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF LOWLAND RICE DURING THE SECOND PLANTING SEASON IN PALEMBANG CITY, INDONESIA
Paper Abstract: Swamp rice cultivation during the second planting season (October-March), known as IP 200, which is directed in 4 sub-districts in Palembang is expected to contribute to rice production for the city of Palembang and to support national food security program.Out of 4 sub-districts, 3 sub-districts were chosen to be the locations of this survey.Respondents of this survey were members of the farmer groups who were selected randomly using proportionate random sampling.The results showed that lowland rice production in the second planting season was influenced significantly by farmers' technical ability in cultivation (X 1 ), production facilities and infrastructure (X 2 ) and irrigation networks (X 3 ).

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Sustainability of Agricultural Practices in Developing Countries**
- **Comment:** The OA topic, while broadly relevant, focuses on the sustainability of agricultural practices which can indeed encompass the productivity of lowland rice. However, it does not directly capture the specific factors influencing rice productivity during the second planting season in Palembang City. Therefore, it can be seen as complementary but not as precise as the OG topic.

**OG Topic: Global Rice Farming Challenges**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the specific focus of the paper, which is the productivity of lowland rice during the second planting season and the influencing factors such as farmers' technical abilities, production facilities, infrastructure, and irrigation networks. This makes it highly relevant to the content of the paper.

**Overall Justification:** While the OA topic is broadly connected and thus complementary, the OG topic is more precise in capturing the study's specific focus on the challenges of rice farming in the second planting season in Palembang City, Indonesia.
