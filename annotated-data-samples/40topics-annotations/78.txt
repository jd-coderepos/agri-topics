Paper Title: Role of Homegarden Agroforestry Practice in Climate Change Adaptation in Aleta Chuko Woreda, Sidama Region, Southern Ethiopia
Paper Abstract: Indeed, the adverse effects of climate change are already evident in resource poor countries including Ethiopia.Southern Ethiopia is known with favorable environment for homegarden agroforestry (HGAF) Production practices.This study aimed at examining the role of HGAF practice in climate change adaptation in Aleta Chuko woreda, Southern Ethiopia.Multistage sampling procedures have used to select sample households.Data were collected from adopter and non-adopter categories of HGAF practice with similar socioeconomic background.A total of 141 households (68 adopters and 73 nonadopter) were involved in the household survey.The result revealed about 95% of the respondents observed the change in rainfall in the past three decades, whether decrease, late-onset or early cessation.While 87.3% of respondents perceived an increase in temperature.Farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change in the area context were soil and water conservation, application of inorganic fertilizer, use of small-scale irrigation and improved crop type were the tactical responses to climate change adaptation in the two adoption categories.It revealed that adoption of HGAF practice exhibit significance difference in terms of adaptation of climate change and sustaining of food security among the two adoption categories.From the result of analysis, access to credit and extension service, educational status, family size and membership of cooperative group shows statistically significant association in adoption of HGAF practices.The study concludes that policies that prioritize interventions to maximize the opportunities for climate change adaptation through HGAF system should been established in the context of the area.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no
which_is_better: OG
comment_OA: wrong
comment_OG: precise
Justification:

OA Topic: Urban Agriculture and Community Development

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it focuses on urban agriculture and community development, which does not align with the paper's focus on homegarden agroforestry practices in rural Southern Ethiopia and their role in climate change adaptation.

OG Topic: Climate Change Adaptation Strategies

    Comment: The OG topic is precise as it directly relates to the studyâ€™s investigation into how homegarden agroforestry practices serve as a strategy for climate change adaptation. This topic accurately captures the core of the research conducted in Southern Ethiopia.

Overall Justification: The OG topic is a precise match for the content of the paper, which focuses on climate change adaptation strategies through agroforestry practices, making it a more suitable choice compared to the OA topic on urban agriculture.
