Paper Title: Mitigating the effect of drought stress on yield in wheat (Triticum aestivum) using arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (Glomus mosseae)
Paper Abstract: The arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus (AMF) (Glomus mosseae) is a beneficial microorganism used in agriculture as an efficient tool to improve plant growth and nutrition by inducing symbiotic association with crops. The present investigation was conducted to study the contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus to drought tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under normal irrigated conditions and in water stress created by withholding irrigation at jointing and heading stage under net house environment. Wheat seeds of two wheat varieties WH 1025 and WH 1105 were grown in pots after treatment with or without the AMF. Under water stress conditions, the wheat variety WH 1025 performed better in terms of growth and yield attributes as compared to WH 1105. The results obtained showed a significant improvement by AMF on plant height, number of productive tillers, spike length, number of spikelet, grain/spike, grain weight/spike and test weight under both irrigated and drought stress condition. Biomass and grain yields were higher in plants treated with mycorrhiza than non-mycorrhizal plants of both the varieties irrespective of soil moisture. Therefore, the results suggest that mycorrhizal inoculation play a vital role in improving growth and yield in wheat by reducing the effects of drought stress and sustain the wheat crop under the semi-arid environments.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Mycorrhizal Fungi and Plant Interactions**
- **Comment:** The OA topic accurately reflects the focus of the paper, which investigates the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in improving drought tolerance and yield in wheat. This topic encompasses the broader field of mycorrhizal fungi and their beneficial interactions with plants.

**OG Topic: Mycorrhizal Fungi and Plant Stress Tolerance**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is also precise and accurately reflects the specific focus of the paper. The study highlights the role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing plant stress tolerance, specifically drought tolerance, which is directly related to the research findings.

**Overall Justification:** Both the OA and OG topics are applicable and accurately reflect different aspects of the study. The OA topic provides a broader context of plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi, while the OG topic zeroes in on the specific aspect of stress tolerance. Therefore, both topics are complementary and well-suited to the paper's content.
