Paper Title: Commercialisation of AR1 in Australia
Paper Abstract: Perennial ryegrass containing a high level of standard (wild) endophyte is a significant component of the feed base for the grazing industries in the high rainfall and irrigated regions of Australia. The AR1 selected endophyte was first commercialised in Australia by Heritage Seeds in autumn 2002 into a market that had low awareness, and a limited understanding, of perennial ryegrass endophyte. The early uptake of AR1 was slow, mainly due to difficulties with delivering a very technical message with limited resources and justifying a significant price increase with no independent supporting data from Australia. Changing the marketing message to focus on the potential benefits from AR1, along with support from the developers of AR1 (AgResearch) and an overall increase in awareness of ryegrass endophyte, saw a dramatic increase in the uptake of AR1 varieties in 2005 and 2006. It is expected that this trend toward selected endophytes will continue into the future. Keywords: perennial ryegrass, endophyte, AR1, commercialisation

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Evolution and Ecology of Endophyte-Grass Symbiosis**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is partially relevant because the study does concern the role of endophytes in perennial ryegrass, which relates to the broader context of endophyte-grass symbiosis. However, the focus of the paper is primarily on the commercialisation of the AR1 endophyte in Australia, including the market strategies and adoption trends, rather than the fundamental ecological or evolutionary aspects of the symbiosis.

**OG Topic: Dairy Pasture and Forage Studies**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is more precise as it situates the study within the context of pasture and forage studies, which are integral to the grazing industries discussed. The paper's focus on the commercial uptake of a particular ryegrass variety is highly relevant to the practical and commercial aspects of pasture and forage management.

**Overall Justification:** While the OA topic touches on a related broader scientific theme, it misses the commercial and practical focus of the paper. The OG topic, while not perfect, aligns better with the application's context and is thus preferable.
