Paper Title: Reaction of Sweet Potatoes to Flooding
Paper Abstract: Flooding is a serious problem in sweet potato production in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Studies have been attempted using irrigation to simulate flooding (1, 3). Results have been inconsistent and flood damage was often difficult to induce. However, during 5 days in 1984, Hurricane Diana resulted in 267.5 mm of rainfall on sweet potato cultivar plots at the Horticultural Crops Research Station in Clinton, N.C. The plots were planted in a Norfolk sandy loam soil. When plots were harvested 2 weeks later, flood damage was readily apparent. Typical symptoms of flooding injury included visible soft, rotted areas, growth of saprophytic fungi on the surface and a noticeable odor of fermentation. Roots were separated into three groups (total marketable, culls, and flood-damaged roots) and weighed. Samples were also taken of apparently sound roots for intercellular space and dry matter evaluations (four roots each) and for determining amount of sub-sequent rotting during curing and storing (12Â–13 kg). Intercellular space and percent dry matter were determined according to Kushman and Pope (2).

OA Topic: Plant Responses to Flooding Stress

    Comment: The OA topic is precise as it directly addresses the study of sweet potatoes' reaction to flooding, which is the main focus of the paper. The experiments conducted were to observe and analyze the effects of flooding on sweet potato crops.

OG Topic: Potato Irrigation & Management

    Comment: The OG topic is wrong because it broadly covers potato irrigation and management, without specifically addressing the context of flooding stress and its impact on sweet potatoes. This misalignment makes it less suitable compared to the OA topic.
