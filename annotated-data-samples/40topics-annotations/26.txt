Paper Title: Water Deficit and Seasonality Study on Essential Oil Constituents of<i>Lippia gracilis</i>Schauer Germplasm
Paper Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze the chemical composition of the essential oil from leaves of Lippia gracilis genotypes, in the dry and rainy seasons, and with and without irrigation. The extraction of essential oil was realized by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger apparatus. The chemical composition analysis was performed using a GC-MS/FID. The leaves of the L. gracilis genotypes provide essential oil with content between 1.25% and 1.92% in the rainy season and 1.42% and 2.70% in the dry season; when irrigation was used the content was between 1.42% and 2.87%, without irrigation contents were between 1.60% and 3.00%. The chemical composition of L. gracilis showed high levels of terpenes. The major constituent of genotypes LGRA-106 was thymol and carvacrol was the major constituent for the other genotypes. Concentrations showed little variation between seasons, demonstrating the stability of the chemical composition of L. gracilis even with different climatic conditions.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Antimicrobial Properties of Essential Oils in Foods**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is incorrect because the paper does not focus on the antimicrobial properties of essential oils, nor does it discuss their application in foods. The study is centered on the chemical composition of essential oils from Lippia gracilis under different water deficit conditions and seasons.

**OG Topic: Essential Oil Agronomy Research**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the study's focus. The research examines how water deficit and seasonality affect the essential oil constituents of Lippia gracilis, aligning well with the theme of essential oil agronomy research. 

**Overall Justification:** The OG topic aligns more closely with the specific focus and content of the paper, accurately encapsulating the study's investigation into the agronomic factors influencing essential oil production.
