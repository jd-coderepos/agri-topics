Paper Title: Aspectos agron√¥micos da mamoneira irrigada com efluentes tratados
Paper Abstract: The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth of the castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) irrigated with two types of treated effluents.The statistical design was a randomized block design in 4 treatments and 6 replications: T1: irrigation with water in soil without fertilizer; T2-irrigation with water in soil with fertilizer; T3-irrigation with pond effluent in soil without fertilizer and T4 irrigation with post-treated pond effluent in soil without fertilizer.Among the treatments, the effect of the water types under the growth of the castor bean was evaluated by means of the following variables: Height Caulinar (AC) in cm; Diameter Caulinar (DC) in mm, number of leaves (NF) and shoot dry matter.T3 had higher mean values 43.1 cm; 24.1 mm and 16.7 units for AC, DC and NF, respectively, followed by T4 with 38.3 cm for AC; 23 mm for DC and 14.3 for NF, showing that the nutrients present in the irrigation waters of T3 and T4 must have had a significant influence.For dry matter, T3 was also the best performance treatment, concluding that treated effluents can be reused in castor bean cultivation with good performance.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Utilization of Forest Biomass for Various Applications**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is incorrect because the study does not concern forest biomass or its applications. Instead, it focuses on the agronomic performance of castor beans irrigated with treated effluents.

**OG Topic: Common Bean Water Efficiency**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is also incorrect because the paper does not deal with common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and their water efficiency. The study specifically addresses the growth of castor beans (Ricinus communis) under different irrigation treatments using treated effluents.

**Overall Justification:** Both assigned topics do not accurately reflect the specific focus or content of the paper. A more suitable topic for this paper would be something like "Agronomic Aspects of Castor Bean Irrigation with Treated Effluents" or "Impact of Treated Effluents on Castor Bean Growth."
