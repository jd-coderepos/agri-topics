Paper Title: Cucumber cultivation technology using tunnel covers
Paper Abstract: Obtaining early cucumber production in the Volgograd region sharp-continental climate with frequent early spring frosts is possible only with using tunnel covers. A distinctive feature of the considered technology is cucumber cultivation using tunnel covers with insulated zone organization by making cracks in the soil with filling them with straw. This provides the comfortable conditions creation for the plants preservation when there is a sharp drop in air and soil temperature in spring and a possible return of spring frosts. Maintaining soil moisture in the 0,5 m layer at the level of 90% of the lowest moisture capacity by drip irrigation allowed to obtain a cucumber yield at the level of 85,9 t/ha, which is 7,8 t/ha more than in the basic option.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Adaptation of Forage Production to Climate Change**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is incorrect because the paper focuses on cucumber cultivation techniques using tunnel covers, specifically aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the climate in the Volgograd region. The study does not address forage production or its adaptation to climate change.

**OG Topic: Cucumber Cultivation Techniques**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is precise and accurately reflects the core focus of the paper. The study explores specific techniques for cucumber cultivation, including the use of tunnel covers and drip irrigation, to improve yield and mitigate the effects of early spring frosts.

**Overall Justification:** The OG topic aligns closely with the specific focus and content of the paper, which centers on technology and techniques for cucumber cultivation. The OA topic does not capture the specific subject matter discussed in the study.
