Paper Title: Irrigation levels and anti-transpirants impact on performance of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea)
Paper Abstract: A field experiment was conducted during 201718 and 201819 at Regional Research Station, Bawal, CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana to examine the consequences of different levels of irrigation and anti-transpirants application on Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czern.]. The experiment consisted of 3 irrigation levels (I1, control; I2, one irrigation at 40 DAS; I3, two irrigations at 40 and 75 DAS), and two varieties (V1, RH-725; V2, RH-749) in main plots, whereas, 4 anti-transpirants (A1, control; A2, PMA @250 ppm at 45 and 90 DAS; A3, 6% kaolin at 45 and 90 DAS and A4, PMA @250 ppm + 6% kaolin at 45 and 90 DAS) in sub plots. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with 3 replications. The results revealed that different irrigation levels and anti-transpirants significantly influenced the performance of RH-749 and RH-725 mustard varieties. Yield attributes such as number of siliquae/plant, siliquae length, number of seeds per siliquae, test weight, seed yield/plant and biological yield were recorded significantly higher during both the years. Whereas, in the case of anti-transpirants, highest biological yield and productivity per day of mustard was recorded in A4 as compared to A1 but it was at par with A3 anti-transpirants. Among the varieties, RH-749 performed better compared to RH-725 under different treatments. The interactive between I3 irrigation level and A4 anti-transpirants was significantly superioras compared to others. Moreover, mustard yield was found significant and positively correlated with different yield attributes.

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Management of Soil Fertility and Crop Productivity" is wrong because the paper does not primarily focus on soil fertility management. Instead, it examines the effects of irrigation levels and anti-transpirant applications on the performance of Indian mustard.

The OG topic "Mustard Irrigation and Yield Studies" is precise because it directly addresses the main focus of the paper, which is the impact of different irrigation levels and anti-transpirants on the yield and yield attributes of Indian mustard. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.
