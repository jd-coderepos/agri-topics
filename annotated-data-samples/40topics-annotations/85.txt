Paper Title: Irrigation Intervals Capacity and Acorbic Acid Treatments on Optimize Growth, and Chemical Constituents of Tecoma Capensis L. Plants
Paper Abstract: The present study was carried out at the Ornamental Horticulture Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Giza, during the two successive seasons of 2014 and 2015 in order to enhancement the growth of Tecoma plants grown under different concentrations of foliar application of ascorbic acid (200 and 400 ppm) and irrigation intervals (3, 5 and 7 days).The results showed that irrigation intervals at 3 days gave the highest values of all growth parameters except root length, fresh and dry weight of roots which increased when plants were treated with irrigation intervals at 7 days.The same treatment increased the chemical constituents except N% in roots, P% in branches and roots, K% in branches and roots, carbohydrates % in roots.Application of ascorbic acid at 400 ppm gave the highest values of the most growth parameters and chemical constituents, followed by ascorbic acid at 200 ppm.The application of ascorbic acid at 400 ppm under irrigation intervals at 3 days gave the highest values of growth parameters and chemical constituents in both seasons.

Paper Title: Irrigation Intervals Capacity and Acorbic Acid Treatments on Optimize Growth, and Chemical Constituents of Tecoma Capensis L. Plants Paper Abstract: The present study was carried out at the Ornamental Horticulture Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University, Giza, during the two successive seasons of 2014 and 2015 in order to enhancement the growth of Tecoma plants grown under different concentrations of foliar application of ascorbic acid (200 and 400 ppm) and irrigation intervals (3, 5 and 7 days).The results showed that irrigation intervals at 3 days gave the highest values of all growth parameters except root length, fresh and dry weight of roots which increased when plants were treated with irrigation intervals at 7 days.The same treatment increased the chemical constituents except N% in roots, P% in branches and roots, K% in branches and roots, carbohydrates % in roots.Application of ascorbic acid at 400 ppm gave the highest values of the most growth parameters and chemical constituents, followed by ascorbic acid at 200 ppm.The application of ascorbic acid at 400 ppm under irrigation intervals at 3 days gave the highest values of growth parameters and chemical constituents in both seasons.

comment_OG: wrong
Justification:

OA Topic: Mechanism of Plant Growth Regulation

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it broadly covers the mechanisms of plant growth regulation, which, while somewhat related, does not specifically address the study's focus on irrigation intervals and ascorbic acid treatments on the growth and chemical constituents of Tecoma plants.

OG Topic: Essential Oil Agronomy Research

    Comment: The OG topic is wrong because it focuses on essential oil agronomy, which is unrelated to the studyâ€™s focus on irrigation intervals and ascorbic acid treatments in Tecoma plants.

Overall Justification: Both topics fail to capture the specific essence of the paper, which is about optimizing growth and chemical constituents of Tecoma plants through irrigation and ascorbic acid treatments. Neither the broader topic of plant growth regulation nor the unrelated topic of essential oil agronomy adequately reflects the study's focus.
