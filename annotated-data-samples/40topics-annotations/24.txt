### Justification:

**OA Topic: Agricultural Development and Policy in South Asia**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is highly relevant as it addresses agricultural development and policy, specifically in the context of a South Asian region (Haryana, India). The study's focus on inter-district inequalities in agricultural and socio-economic development within Haryana aligns well with this topic.

**OG Topic: Agricultural Development and Policies**
- **Comment:** Similarly, the OG topic is also relevant and appropriate for the paper. It broadly covers the themes of agricultural development and policies, which encompasses the paper's analysis of agricultural and socio-economic statistics to identify development disparities across districts in Haryana.

**Overall Justification:** Both topics are suitable and complementary, accurately reflecting the paper's content and focus on regional agricultural and socio-economic development within a South Asian context.
