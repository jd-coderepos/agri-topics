Paper Title: Comparison of Pesticide Residue Levels in Tomatoes from Open Fields, Greenhouses, Markets and Consumers in Kirinyaga County, Kenya
Paper Abstract: The study was carried out to determine and compare pesticide residue levels in tomatoes from Mwea Irrigation Scheme. Thirty five tomato samples of Rambo variety randomly collected from open fields, greenhouses, markets and consumers were analyzed using QuEChERS method. Results showed that pesticide residue leve;s from greenhouse tomatoes was higher compared to open fields, markets and consumers. Alpha-cypermethrin level in greenhouse tomatoes (0.0871±0.0087mg/kg) was significantly (p 0.01) higher than from consumers (0.0218±0.0061mg/kg) while difenoconazole from greenhouse tomatoes (0.2597±0.0522 mg/kg) was significantly (p 0.05) higher than from the open field (0.0295±0.0014 mg/kg). Carbendazim level in greenhouse (1.2341±0.1667 mg/kg) tomatoes was significantly (p 0.001) higher than from open fields (0.0596±0.0178 mg/kg), markets (0.1160±0.0490 mg/kg) and consumers (0.0494±0.0155 mg/kg). Imidacloprid in greenhouse tomatoes (0.1446±0.0086 mg/kg) was significantly (p 0.001) higher than from the markets (0.0236±0.0019 mg/kg) and consumers (0.0170±0.0017 mg/kg). High pesticide residue levels in tomatoes are a health concern for consumers. Enforcing the food safety laws, enhancing farmer training on safe use of pesticides and creating awareness on pesticide risks would promote production of uncontaminated crops consumed locally.

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Analysis of Pesticide Residues in Food**
- **Comment:** The OA topic accurately reflects the focus of the paper, which involves analyzing pesticide residues in tomatoes from various sources (open fields, greenhouses, markets, and consumers). It captures the essence of the study, which is the detection and comparison of pesticide residue levels in food.

**OG Topic: Pesticide Risk and Residue Analysis**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is also accurate and precise. It reflects the focus on both the analysis of pesticide residues and the associated risks, which ties closely with the health concerns mentioned in the study.

**Overall Justification:** Both topics accurately capture different aspects of the study, making them equally applicable. The OA topic provides a broad but relevant categorization, while the OG topic adds the risk component, making them complementary and equally relevant.
