Paper Title: Impact of irrigation on pasture production on two sheep and beef farms in the Central Wairarapa
Paper Abstract: The impact of irrigation on seasonal and annual pasture production was investigated on two sheep and beef farms in the Central Wairarapa over 4 years (2004-08). The pasture response to irrigation water at Brancepeth Station ranging from 37 to 63% in the first 3 years, while at Glenlean the pasture response was only 22 and 26% in the 2 years (2004/05 and 2006/07, respectively) the irrigation treatment was imposed. Keywords: water harvesting, irrigation, seasonal water deficit

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Evolution and Sustainability of Livestock Farming Systems**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is too broad and does not specifically address the main focus of the paper, which is the impact of irrigation on pasture production. While it touches on livestock farming systems broadly, the paper's specific emphasis on irrigation and pasture yield makes this topic less accurate.

**OG Topic: Dairy Pasture and Forage Studies**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is more precise and accurately captures the focus of the paper. The study specifically investigates the effect of irrigation on pasture production, which is central to pasture and forage studies. This topic aligns better with the content and objectives described in the abstract.
