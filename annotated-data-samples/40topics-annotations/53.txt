Paper Title: Yield components of the new seedless table grape BRS Ísis as affected by the rootstock under semi-arid tropical conditions
Paper Abstract: The new seedless table grape cultivar BRS Ísis has high bud fertility, yield and tolerance to downy mildew; its planted area is rapidly increasing in the Vale do São Francisco region in the Northeast of Brazil. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the yield performance, yield components, physical and chemical characteristics of the fruit of the cultivar BRS Ísis grafted onto different rootstocks in irrigated growing in the semi-arid region of Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a commercial vineyard in Petrolina, Pernambuco, over six production cycles in the period 2015-2018. The treatments were represented by the rootstocks IAC 572, IAC 766, IAC 313, Freedom, Harmony, Paulsen 1103, and SO4 in a randomized block design with four replications. There was a greater effect of the production cycle than of the rootstock on all the variables studied, with significant differences between rootstocks in some cycles and/or in the overall mean of the production cycles. Mean production of the six cycles was greatest for IAC 572, at 27 Kg (45 ton/ha/cycle) and 100 clusters per grapevine. The physical characteristics of the clusters and berries and chemical composition of the grape achieved the standards described for the cultivar BRS Ísis and market demands for all the rootstocks.

Evaluation output:

comment_OA: complementary
comment_OG: wrong

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Genetic and Environmental Factors in Grapevine Cultivation**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is complementary as it ties into the larger discussion of how genetic and environmental factors (such as rootstock selection) can influence grapevine cultivation. However, the OA topic is more general and does not specifically address the yield components and the effects on the new seedless table grape cultivar BRS Ísis under semi-arid conditions.

**OG Topic: Vine Water Stress & Grape Quality**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is wrong because the paper does not focus primarily on water stress. Instead, it investigates how different rootstocks affect the yield and quality of the seedless table grape cultivar BRS Ísis under irrigated conditions in a semi-arid region.

**Overall Justification:** Both assigned topics do not precisely capture the specific focus or content of the paper. The OA topic is complementary but too broad, while the OG topic is incorrect. A more accurate topic would be something like "Effects of Rootstock on Yield and Quality of Seedless Table Grape Cultivated in Semi-Arid Conditions" or "Rootstock Influence on BRS Ísis Grape Cultivation in Semi-Arid Regions."
