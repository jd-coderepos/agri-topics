Paper Title: Fall Control of Oriental Beetle Grubs with Insecticides and Entomogenous Nematodes on a Golf Course J 1987
Paper Abstract: Four insecticides and 1 species of entomogenous nematode were applied to a rough at Lido Beach Country Club, Long Island, N.Y., on 12 Aug fori control of Oriental beetle grubs. The rough consisted of annual bluegrass (75%) and broadleaf weeds (25%). The experimental design was a randomized! complete block with 4 replications. Individual plots were 10 × 10 ft. Granular materials were applied with a precalibrated Gandy 2.5 spreader. Liquid,- materials were premeasured in the laboratory and applied in 2 directions within each plot with 11.4 liters (3 gal) of water through a watering can. At treatment time-(12 Aug) the following environmental conditions existed: air temperature, 81°F; soil temperature, 86°F (1 inch), 82°F (3 inches); soil pH 6.1; water pH 5.84; soil moisture, 21.4%; soil texture, 7.9% coarse sand, 45.5% medium sand, 36.4% fine sand, 5.9% very fine sand, and 4.3% silt and clay; thatch, 0.25 inches. Following treatment, the plots recieved 0.5 inches of irrigation by sprinkler. The nematodes, Heterorhabditis sp. (strain HP 88), were applied on 20 Aug at a rate of 5 billion/acre in 5 liters of water through a sprinkling can to the center 4 sq ft of each plot. The nematode application site was immediately watered in by hand with additional water for a total of 11.4 liters. At this time the following environmental conditions existed: air temperature, 84°F; soil temp, 79°F (1 inch). Posttreatment counts were taken on 22 Sep by cutting a 1- × 3-ft strip lengthwise through the middle of each plot by hand and examining the sod and underlying soil for grubs. A 3-sq-ft sample of sod was examined in each plot, and the surviving grubs were counted. Grub species identifications were made in the field. At this time oriental beetle grubs were 80% third instars and 20% second instars.

Justification:

OA Topic: Botanical Insecticides in Agriculture and Pest Management

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it focuses on botanical insecticides and general pest management in agriculture, which does not specifically relate to the study on the control of Oriental beetle grubs on a golf course using insecticides and entomogenous nematodes.

OG Topic: Golf Course Grub Control

    Comment: The OG topic is precise as it directly addresses the study’s focus on controlling beetle grubs on a golf course. The use of specific insecticides and entomogenous nematodes to manage grub populations is specifically aligned with this topic.

Overall Justification: The OG topic accurately captures the essence of the paper, which is centered on evaluating insecticide and nematode treatments for grub control on a golf course, making it a more suitable choice compared to the OA topic which is too broad and unrelated.
