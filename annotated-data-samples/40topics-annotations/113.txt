Paper Title: EVALUATION OF BELBAIS DRAIN WATER QUALITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF USING IN AGRICULTURAL IRRIGATION PURPOSES IN SHARKIA GOVERNORATE, EGYPT
Paper Abstract: A total of 8 water samples were collected from beginning, middle and end of Belbais drain, which located at longitudes of N 30o 10 57.6 and E 31o 20 20.8 and latitudes of N 30o33 39.2 and E 31o36 10.3 and altitude around 11.6 m. relative to sea level, in order to assess the quality of its water and its suitability for agricultural irrigation. Samples were analysed for pH, EC and other parameters. pH was within the permissible limit. EC indicates C3 (high salinity). According to USDA (1954). The soluble sodium percent (SSP) ranged from 67.78% to 41.69%, i.e. moderate restriction in using this water. The Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) ranged from 6.74 to 8.44 and according to FAO (1985), water is of low sodium hazard. According to USDA (1954), water is of high salinity medium sodicity (C3S2). Permeability index values varied between 82.52 to 85.34% and based on Doneen diagram (1962), medicating class II i.e. no permeability or infiltration problems. Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) was 1.25 mmolc L-1, i.e. safe for irrigation.

Evaluation output: 
match_with_OA: no

which_is_better: OG

comment_OA: wrong

comment_OG: precise

Justification:

The OA topic "Deficit Irrigation for Agricultural Water Management" is wrong because the paper does not discuss deficit irrigation. Instead, it assesses the quality of drain water and its suitability for agricultural irrigation.

The OG topic "Irrigation Water Quality Analysis" is precise because it directly addresses the main focus of the paper, which is the evaluation of the water quality from Belbais drain and determining its suitability for irrigation purposes. Therefore, the OG topic more accurately reflects the content of the paper.
