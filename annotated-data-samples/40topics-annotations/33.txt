Paper Title: Balanced Fertilization for Improved Nutrient use Efficiency and Mulberry Productivity
Paper Abstract: Aim: To study the effects of balanced fertilization in improving leaf yield, quality and nutrient use efficiency in mulberry. Study Design: Experiment was conducted in randomized block design (RBD) consisting of 7 treatments in 3 replications. Place and Duration of Study: The present study was conducted at Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute, Berhampore ((Latitude 24ยบ05?N Longitude 88ยบ15?E; 18 m MSL), West Bengal, India in two seasons during 2018 (July-August; September-October). Methodology: Existing S-1635 mulberry plantation (10year-old; 60 cm ร 60 cm spacing; net plot area: 32 m2) was utilized. Experiments were conducted in two seasons (July-August, 2018; September-October, 2018) in randomized block design (RBD) consisting of 7 treatments in 3 replications. The treatments in this study included, T1: 100% N-P2O5-K2O+S+Zn with Urea-SSP-10:26:26 + Bentonite Sulphur (8 kg ha-1) + Zinc Sulphate (1 kg ha-1) as BF; T2: 75% BF; T3: 100% N-P2O5-K2O alone (Urea-SSP-10:26:26); T4: 75% N-P2O5-K2O alone (Urea-SSP-10:26:26); T5: 100% N-P2O5-K2O alone (Urea-DAP-MOP); T6: 100% N-P2O5-K2O alone (Urea-SSP-MOP) as farmers? practice (FP); T7: Nutrients omission plot (Control). The recommended fertilizer dose (100%) for irrigated mulberry production in the Eastern region is N-P2O5-K2O=67-36-22 kg ha-1 crop-1. All the fertilizers were applied in two equal splits on 15th and 30th day after pruning. Results: This study reveals the importance of balanced fertilization of mulberry with N, P, K, S and Zn for sustainable productivity, which is reflected by the maximum values for leaf yield attributes, chlorophyll content and leaf yield. Further, mulberry leaf quality (in terms of total soluble protein and total soluble sugar) significantly improved with balanced fertilization. Higher PFP and AUE were also recorded with fertilization with compound/complex fertilizers than with straight fertilizers; but the balanced fertilization exhibited remarkable enhancement. Conclusion: The results prove that balanced fertilization of N-P2O5-K2O @ 67-36-22 kg ha-1 (Urea-SSP-10:26:26) with Bentonite sulphur (8 kg ha-1) and zinc sulphate (1 kg ha-1) were effective in improving mulberry productivity through enhanced nutrient use efficiency. This could be useful for realizing maximum productivity in mulberry as an efficient nutrient management strategy in mulberry cultivation.

Evaluation output:

### Justification:

**OA Topic: Artificial Diet Rearing System for Silkworm Bombyx mori**
- **Comment:** The OA topic is incorrect because the paper focuses on the effects of balanced fertilization on mulberry productivity and nutrient use efficiency, not on the rearing system or diet of silkworms.

**OG Topic: Berry Cultivation Enhancements**
- **Comment:** The OG topic is also incorrect because the paper does not discuss berry cultivation. Instead, it deals with fertilization practices to improve mulberry leaf yield and quality, which is specifically relevant to mulberry cultivation for sericulture.

**Overall Justification:** Both assigned topics do not accurately reflect the focus or content of the paper. The paper is primarily about fertilization strategies to enhance mulberry productivity and nutrient use efficiency, which would be better captured by a topic such as "Mulberry Fertilization and Productivity Improvements" or "Nutrient Management in Mulberry Cultivation."
