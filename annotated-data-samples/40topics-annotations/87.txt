Paper Title: HARVESTING IRRIGATED ALFALFA IN THE ESTABLISHMENT YEAR IN SOUTHWESTERN SASKATCHEWAN
Paper Abstract: Four alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars, Beaver, Roamer, Dupuits and Alfa, were seeded on an alluvial clay loam soil in a randomized complete block design experiment in each of the 4 yr from 1976 to 1979 and again in 1981 at Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The plots were irrigated at a level to meet the evapotranspiration demand for maximum forage yield. The effect on future yields of harvesting once in the establishment year (approx. 15) was established by determining forage yields for 4, 4, 3, 2 and 2 yr subsequent to the establishment year, respectively. Establishment year harvesting reduced the subsequent yield of Beaver and Alfa cultivars in the 1976 and 1977 seedings. There were no significant effects in 1978, 1979 and 1981 seedings from establishment year harvesting. It was noted when significant yield reductions did occur in the post-establishment yields that the establishment year yield compensates and the total production of the stand is not affected. Roamer was superior to Beaver which was better than Alfa and Dupuits in winterhardiness at this location. Variation in the significance of establishment year treatments among seeding years indicated that establishment year management trials should be sequently seeded for at least 3 yr to evaluate management × environment interaction effects on perennial crops.Key words: Alfalfa, medicago, cutting, yield, winterkill

Justification:

OA Topic: Diversity and Conservation of Vascular Plants in Central Europe

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it focuses on the diversity and conservation of vascular plants in Central Europe, which is not related to the study on the effect of harvesting irrigated alfalfa on future yields in southwestern Saskatchewan.

OG Topic: Dairy Pasture and Forage Studies

    Comment: The OG topic is complementary as it broadly covers studies on pasture and forage, which includes research on alfalfa—a key forage crop. Although the topic is not as precise as it could be, it still relates to the broader field of forage studies, addressing aspects of yield and management that are relevant to alfalfa cultivation.

Overall Justification: The OG topic, while not perfectly specific, is related to the broader field of pasture and forage studies and thus can be considered complementary to the content of the paper. The OA topic is completely unrelated, focusing on a different geographical and biological context.
