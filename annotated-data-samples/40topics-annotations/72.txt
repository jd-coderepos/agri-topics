Paper Title: Co-inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense in soybean cultivars subjected to water déficit
Paper Abstract: This study aimed to verify the effect of co-inoculation, association between Azospirillum brasilense and Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteria, on soybean plants subjected to water deficit at two sowing dates. Two field experiments were conducted at the Universidade Federal de Tocantins, campus of Palmas, Brazil, in 2016. The experimental design was randomized blocks in a split-split-plot arrangement with four repetitions, where the plots consisted of two irrigation depths (100 and 25% of crop evapotranspiration - ETc), the subplots was composed of two methods of inoculant application (inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and co-inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense + Bradyrhizobium japonicum) and the sub-subplots comprised two soybean cultivars (TMG 132 and ANTA 82). The cultivars responded differently to the sowing dates. Co-inoculation did not influence grain yield under full irrigation conditions (100% ETc), in neither cultivar evaluated. However, under the water deficit condition (25% ETc), the grain yield of the cultivar TMG 132 increased 77.20%, indicating that there are different responses of interaction between Azospirillum brasilense, plant genotype and sowing dates.

Justification:

OA Topic: Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation in Legumes

    Comment: The OA topic is wrong because it focuses on the broader concept of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, whereas the paper is specifically about the effect of co-inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense and Bradyrhizobium japonicum on soybean yield under water deficit.

OG Topic: Crop Enhancement Through Inoculation

    Comment: The OG topic is precise as it directly relates to the study’s focus on enhancing crop performance (i.e., soybean yield) through inoculation techniques, particularly under conditions of water deficit.

Overall Justification: The OG topic more accurately captures the essence of the paper, which is the study of co-inoculation effects on soybean yield under varying irrigation conditions, making it a better fit than the OA topic.
